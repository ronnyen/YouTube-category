Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"As President Donald Trump wraps up his 13-day Asia diplomacy trip, a political firestorm has blown up in his own party back home. Appearing on ABCâ€™s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the â€œconduct describedâ€ in the allegationsâ€ should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.â€ She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside â€œif the allegations are true.â€\nConway went on to state that the president isnâ€™t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\nâ€œI will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,â€ Conway said. â€œSo he made a statement, heâ€™s sticking by that statement.â€\nShe continued, â€œHeâ€™s not being briefed on this bit by bit. Heâ€™s very focused on trade agreements. Heâ€™s very focused on global cooperation on a ........â€\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesnâ€™t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldnâ€™t always be prosecuting people through the press.",25

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, November 11th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nVIEWER TOPICS\n\nRob Sanders - Hi John. Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure thereâ€™s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? Iâ€™ve been excited for the movie but donâ€™t know how to take the limited reactions Iâ€™ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If thatâ€™s the case, why doesnâ€™t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?",24

"MÃ˜ 'When I Was Young' Official Video \n\nâ€œI'm so happy to present this video because it feels very true to the song and to who I am. It was inspired by a painting called â€˜The Dance Of Lifeâ€™ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. Itâ€™s an illustration of three womenâ€”one in white, one in red and one in blackâ€”and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it. Since â€˜When I Was Youngâ€™ is all about nostalgia and reflecting on lifeâ€”especially the past, but also the now and the futureâ€”it just seemed like the perfect time to do it.â€  - MÃ˜\n \nWhen I Was Young EP Out Now:\nRetail: http://smarturl.it/WIWYRet\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WIWYIT\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WIWYAM\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WIWYSP\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/WIWYGP\n \nWhen I Was Young (Lyric Video): http://smarturl.it/WIWYYT\n \nRoots (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RootsYT\nTurn My Heart to Stone (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/TMHTSYT\nLinking With You (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/LWYYT\nBb (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/BbYTB\nRun Away (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RAYT\n \nMÃ˜ on Tour with Cashmere Cat: http://smarturl.it/MeowTour\n\nFollow MÃ˜: \nWebsite - http://momomoyouth.com\nFacebook - http://smarturl.it/MOfacebook\nInstagram - http://smarturl.it/MOinstagram\nTwitter - http://smarturl.it/MOtwitter\nMailer - http://smarturl.it/MOmail\n \nWhen I Was Young Lyrics:\n \nWhen the sky was gold\nand I needed no protection\nas the wind would blow\na 1000 miles in no direction\nman it was a beautiful sight\ndays were soaked in sunlight\njust so long ago\nbut lately I like to imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it would do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nwhen I was young\n\nNow the sky is grey\nbut honestly it doesn't hurt me\nI learned to find my way\non the path of no returning\nEverything I've left behind\nI'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes\nwe were so bold and brave\nbaby can you imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it could do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n\nWhen I was young\nwe would play with fire\nWhen I was young\nand we would fuck the price\nwhen I was young\nIt was do or die I would give my life just to feel like\nWhen I was young\n \nAnd the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n \nMusic video by MÃ˜ performing When I Was Young (C) 2017 Sony Music Recordings, Inc.",10

"***We are having technical difficulties with the video! So sorry! Iï¸t will be back up and running soon! \n\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. Itâ€™s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesnâ€™t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, itâ€™s just that itâ€™s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes Iâ€™m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. Iâ€™d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\n\nMusic Used: \nAvocado Street\nGymnopedie No1\nReflection Pool\nLife in Romance\nSimple Story",26

"We are seeing a flood of videos on YouTube from iPhone users who have gotten their hands on the new iPhone X and are trying to trick the Face ID. When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenbergâ€™s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/",28

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\n\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.

As you see, Face ID has been enabled.\n\nBecause no one stands in front of it, the iPhone asks me to enter the passcode to access it.\n\nNow, I will try unlocking this iPhone with a specially crafted mask. \n\nWoa, as you see, I have successfully unlocked the iPhone X with the mask.\n\nThis iPhone is mine, clearly I can easily unlock it with my face.\n\nIn conclusion, Face ID on this iPhone X is not as secure as Apple has announced. \n\nThank you !\n____________________________________\n\nWebsite Bkav: http://bkav.com\nFacebook Bkav: https://www.facebook.com/BkavCorp",28

Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if youâ€™re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until itâ€™s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow hereâ€™s where youâ€™re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. Thereâ€™s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.",26

"In Theaters April 20, 2018\n\nwww.RampageTheMovie.com\nwww.facebook.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.twitter.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.instagram.com/RampageTheMovie\n\n--\n\nGlobal megastar Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure â€œRampage,â€ directed by Brad Peyton.  \n\nPrimatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, itâ€™s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n â€œRampageâ€ also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (â€œMoonlightâ€), Malin Akerman (TVâ€™s â€œBillionsâ€), Jake Lacy (TVâ€™s â€œGirlsâ€), Joe Manganiello (TVâ€™s â€œTrue Bloodâ€) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TVâ€™s â€œThe Walking Deadâ€); as well as P.J. Byrne (â€œThe Wolf of Wall Streetâ€), Marley Shelton (â€œSolaceâ€), Breanne Hill (â€œSan Andreasâ€), Jack Quaid (â€œThe Hunger Games: Catching Fireâ€), and Matt Gerald (TVâ€™s â€œDaredevilâ€). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\nâ€œRampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit â€œSan Andreas.â€  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (â€œSan Andreasâ€), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, â€œStar Wars: The Last Jediâ€), editor Jim May (â€œGoosebumpsâ€) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (â€œDawn of the Planet of the Apesâ€).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for â€œSan Andreasâ€ and â€œJourney 2: The Mysterious Island.â€\nThe â€œRampageâ€ creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (â€œSan Andreas,â€ â€œX-Men: Apocalypseâ€), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (â€œThe Lord of the Ringsâ€ Trilogy, â€œDawn of the Planet of the Apesâ€).\n\nâ€œRampageâ€ opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, â€œRampageâ€ will be distributed by Warner Bros.

"Paper Magazine debuted a racy cover featuring Nicki Minaj. Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

"After public encouragement from Donald Trump, the Department of Justice is reportedly deciding whether or not to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton. Trump and his supporters are so very passionate about Hillary Clinton, it seems like maybe they forgot she lost. She is not the President but we went out on the street and asked people if Hillary Clinton should be impeached. She does not have a job but did that stop people from demanding she be removed from office?\n\nWORLD PREMIERE TRAILER â€“ Jimmy Kimmelâ€™s The Terrific Ten https://youtu.be/t8Jq6NqCQ1o\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nShould Hillary Clinton Be Impeached?\nhttps://youtu.be/oMupq6zB1Tc",24

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in.

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as itâ€™s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?",24

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of â€˜Justice Leagueâ€™s Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantinoâ€™s next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-â€˜Halloweenâ€™ Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake â€˜What Men Wantâ€™ in the works at Paramount; Empireâ€™s Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes wonâ€™t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ETâ€”nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say thereâ€™s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, itâ€™s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illuminationâ€™s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouseâ€™s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame weâ€™ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empireâ€˜s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues.

"It may be crazy, but it's happening! Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150",2

"To use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com\nOur story: \nWe are seeing a flood of videos on YouTube from iPhone users who have gotten their hands on the new iPhone X and are trying to trick the Face ID. When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenbergâ€™s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/",28

"The teaser trailer for Incredibles 2 is here.\n\nDisney/Pixar's Incredibles 2 opens in theatres in 3D June 15th, 2018.\n\nEveryoneâ€™s favorite family of superheroes is back in â€œIncredibles 2â€ â€“ but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of â€œnormalâ€ life. Itâ€™s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jackâ€™s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together againâ€”which is easier said than done, even when theyâ€™re all Incredible.\n \nDirected by Brad Bird (â€œIron Giant,â€ â€œThe Incrediblesâ€) and produced by John Walker (â€œThe Incrediblesâ€) and Nicole Grindle (â€œSanjayâ€™s Super Teamâ€ short, â€œToy Story 3â€ associate producer), â€œIncredibles 2â€ busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.",1

"Why the Zimbabwe coup is not a revolution.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOn November 14th 2017,  Zimbabwe military troops drove tanks into the capital city, Harare. They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insistâ€¦.\nThis is not a military takeover of government. \n\nOnce praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabweâ€™s new constitution with the support of the people. \n\nBut soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.\n\nHe secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.\n\nAnd even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, thereâ€™s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. \n\nNow that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.\n\nAnd itâ€™s caused a split in Mugabeâ€™s own party, the ZANU-PF.\nOn one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabeâ€™s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabweâ€™s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.   \n\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised the company's first electric semi-truck would be mind-blowing, and he delivered. \n\nMusk took the wraps off the big rig on Thursday at Tesla's Design Studio in Hawthorne, California, and the vehicle's design was definitely what got the most attention. \n\nThe semi can go 0-60 mph in five seconds without a trailer attached. \n\nThe big rig has an impressive range of 500 miles per charge. With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",2

"Automation is coming for truckers â€“ but first, they're being watched.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nThe promise of self-driving trucks will radically reshape one of America's most common jobs. There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact itâ€™s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Letâ€™s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - itâ€™s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no oneâ€™s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long â€˜legsâ€™ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno",27

"The Hudson Union www.hudsonunionsociety.com is where everyone comes to be inspired, to change our world.\n\nCheck us out on Twitter @ActualJoePascal\n\nBryan Cranston won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Walter White in AMCâ€™s Breaking Bad. He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOXâ€™s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boyâ€™s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranstonâ€™s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin.",1

"I tried the intense diet and fitness regimens that 40-year-old NFL quarterback Tom Brady touts in his new book The TB 12 Method. Along with a diet that's heavy on vegetables and lean protein, Brady stays away from alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and sugar. \n\nThis is what it was like to eat and train like Tom Brady for a week, including a taste test of the avocado ice cream Brady is known to enjoy. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nI just tried the Tom Brady diet for a week. So, Tom Brady's got this new book called The TB12 Method. In the book, he outlines in detail the fitness regimens he undertakes and diet as well. Tom Brady's nutrition plan definitely made me tweak my already-okay diet. \n\nIn terms of the food that I ate during the week, you're staying away from sugars and dairies and refined carbohydrates, etc. It's a lot of vegetables, lean white meats. We had ground turkey burgers over lots of greens, peppers, and carrots. We also had a grilled chicken breast, some Brussels sprouts, and then quinoa. Then during the day, I would eat an apple. I would eat almonds.\n\nTom Brady is all about the hydration and constantly drinking water. It's recommended that you take your total body weight, cut that in half, and then drink the corresponding amount of ounces of water that's half your body weight. Every day I would drink approximately 90 ounces of water. Three big Poland Spring bottles of water.\n\nIn terms of caffeine, I usually drink like four cups of coffee a day on average, which is a lot. It's too much. Tom Brady â€” he does not drink caffeine, but he recommended a maximum amount of 200 milligrams of caffeine a day,  and that equals two cups of coffee.\n\nIn terms of alcohol, Tom Brady, in the book, says that he does occasionally have a cocktail, but he says that, if you're going to drink alcohol, you need to match the ounce-amount of alcohol that you drink with water. So if you have a 12-ounce beer, you need to drink a 12-ounce glass of water.\n\nOne of the dishes that I tried was the avocado ice cream, which Tom Brady's been famous for making before. I wasn't a fan of the avocado ice cream. Sorry, Tom.\n\nOverall, the Tom Brady TB12 experience was a big improvement over my regular routine. I love always focusing on eating healthy and avoiding unhealthy, rich, sugary foods. I think this is definitely a positive tweak for me. I feel like it's already had a positive impact on me. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

"Earthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure youâ€™re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure youâ€™re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (donâ€™t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers youâ€™ll need, medications, and supplies that youâ€™ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that donâ€™t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nItâ€™s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty",26

"Scientists were surprised and delighted to detect --for the first time--  an interstellar asteroid passing through our solar system. Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named â€˜Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongatedâ€”perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

Celebrations in the streets of Harare after news that long time President Robert Mugabe has resigned. CNN's David McKenzie reports.,25
"President Donald Trump implicitly endorsed embattled GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore on Tuesday, telling reporters that we don't need a liberal Democrat in that seat as he left the White House for a Thanksgiving trip to Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nRoy Moore denies it â€” that's all I can say, he said, breaking a silence on the sexual misconduct allegations levied against Moore by nearly 10 women. The allegations include incidents with women under the age of 16 when he was in his 30s.\n\nMoore has vehemently denied the allegations. But he has done little over the past few weeks to clear up what has emerged as a pattern from the women.\n\nAnd by the way, he totally denies it, Trump said. The president also said the recent spike in women coming forward to share their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted by powerful men is a good thing for US society.\n\nTrump, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct from more than a dozen women during last year's presidential campaign â€” claims he said were all lies â€” had not previously addressed the Moore allegations. But amid his trip to Asia, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believed if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\n\nTrump's comments come a day after White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox & Friends that Democratic nominee Doug Jones, the candidate running against Moore in Alabama, will be a vote against tax cuts and is weak on crime. Though she didn't explicitly tell viewers to vote for Moore, she said, I'm telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Tuesday that Conway spoke with Trump about the Alabama Senate race prior to appearing on the Fox News morning show.\n\nIn a Tuesday press conference, Dean Young, a strategist for Moore's campaign, said Conway's comments amounted to an endorsement of their candidate from the White House.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter and an assistant to him in the White House, told The Associated Press that there is a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\n\nI've yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts, she said.\n\nMoore has been disavowed by most of the Republican elected officials in Washington, DC. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee had already withdrawn their support for his candidacy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

"On our darkest day, they were our greatest hope. Watch the new trailer for #12StrongMovie.\nâ€”\nChris Hemsworth and Oscar nominee, Michael Shannon, star in 12 STRONG, a powerful new war drama from Alcon Entertainment, Black Label Media and Jerry Bruckheimer Films. \n\nSet in the harrowing days following 9/11, a U.S. Special Forces team, led by their new Captain, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), is chosen to be the first U.S. troops sent into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. There, in the rugged mountains, they must convince Northern Alliance General Dostum (Navid Negahban) to join forces with them to fight their common adversary: the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. In addition to overcoming mutual distrust and a vast cultural divide, the Americansâ€”accustomed to state-of-the-art warfareâ€”must adopt the rudimentary tactics of the Afghani horse soldiers. But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.\n\nDirected by Nicolai Fuglsig and based on the acclaimed â€œHorse Soldiersâ€ book by best-selling author Doug Stanton, 12 STRONG also stars Michael PeÃ±a, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell, Ben Oâ€™Toole, Austin Hebert, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Laith Nakli, Fahim Fazli, Yousuf Azami, Said Taghmaoui, Elsa Pataky, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\nâ€”\nFollow #12StrongMovie on social media:\nhttp://12strongmovie.com \nhttp://facebook.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://twitter.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://instagram.com/12StrongMovie",24

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, November 21st 2017) John talks about the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nMeghan Dunn - I really liked Murder on the Orient Express and I just heard that Fox is setting up a sequel with Death on the Nile. Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JLâ€™s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?",24

"Raising children requires good parenting techniques as well as avoiding bad habits.  A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Of course we had to ramp things up by using a microcontroller to switch it on an off, but you can just use a high current power supply or variable transformer. Please double check the current rating vs. temperature of the manufacturers data sheet to make sure you're getting to the temperature needed.

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simonâ€™s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simonâ€™s Cat merchandise?\nA.

The unique 5-in-1 aperture design not only allows you to enjoy sauces from a multitude of restaurants but also holds the sauce containers snugly in place. \nThe universal vent mount weâ€™ve chosen is the best on the market, utilizing a 25% thicker gauge metal than a traditional vent mount. This ensures that the DipClip will be securely fastened to the vent in just about any car. \nThis video is a brief demonstration of some of the rigorous testing we put DipClip through before we felt it was ready for release!\n\n#SafeSauce\n*Dip Responsible.

"The tryptophan in turkey gets a bad rap every Thanksgiving. Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThatâ€™s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage thatâ€™s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",28

"This is neat, and surprisingly cheap too.  Instead of just being a panel indicator light it also displays the supply voltage.  That's a very nice solution for quick diagnostics.  The quality of construction seems OK.  Very simple and well rated components for standard mains voltages, although the sense resistor may not be rated for the higher phase to phase voltages.\nPower dissipation is low at about half a watt with predictably poor power factor (0.07) because of the simple capacitive dropper and low circuit voltage.  There's no significant heat being dissipated on the PCB.\n\nThe music track referenced is an old fairground classic called Dominator:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dohzrXT09w\nCarl Cox mix:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYvrXtmrLSY\n\nHere's a universal ebay search link for the meters:-\nhttps://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&_nkw=22mm+voltmeter&_sop=15\n\nIf you enjoy these videos you can help support the channel with a dollar for coffee, cookies and random gadgets for disassembly at:-\nhttp://www.bigclive.com/coffee.htm\nThis also keeps the channel independent of YouTube's advertising algorithms allowing it to be a bit more dangerous and naughty.",28

"Here is what you'll need!\n\n1. A Chinese takeout container unfolds into a plate! \nRemove the metal handle from the box, and unfold the tabs on either side. It will unfold into a convenient paper plate!  \n\n2. You probably don't realize it, but your pots come with built-in spoon rests.\nDonâ€™t rest your stirring spoon on the kitchen counter, it will only spread mess! Instead, put your spoon into the hole at the end of your pot handle.\n\n3.You've been dispensing Tic Tacs the hard way.\nYou probably dispense your mints by furiously shaking the box upside down, only for a heap of them to spill out. Instead turn the box upside down, slowly open the lid, and then pull the box back. A single mint will be sitting in a tic tac-shaped groove inside the lid. \n\n4. Play Doh is for cleaning wallpaper.\nWhat now is an iconic, squishy, children's toy, was originally invented for the purpose of cleaning wallpaper.\n\n5. Your bobby pins are on upside down\nThe correct way to wear a bobby pin is the flat side up for maximum hold! \n\n6. Does your foil roll never stay in the box?\nMost aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and kitchen paper rolls come with punch-in tabs on either sides of the box. The tabs hold the roller in place as you pull on your foil. \n\n7. You're probably using the wrong plunger.\nThe classic brown suction cupped plunger is actually for clearing blockages in a sink, not your toilet! A toilet plunger has a double thrust force cup to help get deep down into the block and has extra force for tough clogs. \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33836\n\n\nMUSIC\nBoss Man\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.",26

"Shared space designs, explained.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nSome cities in Europe are undergoing a fascinating transformation: theyâ€™re getting rid of all of their road signs.  Thatâ€™s thanks to a design concept called â€œshared space,â€ where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.Â  Thereâ€™s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection,Â in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark â€” and thatâ€™s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residentsâ€™ needs. \n\nThis is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership withÂ 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design.Â 99% InvisibleÂ is a member ofÂ Radiotopia.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"I used the iPhone X for 2 weeks. I donâ€™t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinionâ€¦ There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

"Nursing is the job of the future. So why have men stayed away?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nItâ€™s easy to imagine that the jobs of the future, if they even exist, will all revolve around technology. But it turns out, the jobs that are least likely to succumb to automation are those that involve building human relationships. The healthcare field is a prime exampleâ€” nurses, physician assistants, and physical therapists have higher-than-average salaries and major expected job growth. These fields share something else in commonâ€” theyâ€™re dominated by women. Despite the erosion of traditionally â€œmasculineâ€ fields like manufacturing, men just arenâ€™t taking these high-paying, in-demand healthcare jobs in the numbers youâ€™d expect. For decades, nursing in particular has been considered â€œwomenâ€™s work,â€ in part because itâ€™s assumed that women, more so than men, have a kind of innate capacity for caring and empathy. But men in nursing say this mindset is holding us back. For them, caring and empathy are stills that can be developed, not traits someone is worth with or without based on their gender.\n\nOxford University study on which jobs are most vulnerable to automation: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\n\nMen in Nursing, History, Challenges, and Opportunities (book by Chad O'Lynn): http://www.springerpub.com/men-in-nursing.html\n\nFlorence Nightingale and the Nursing Legacy (book by Monica Baly): https://books.google.com/books/about/Florence_Nightingale_and_the_Nursing_Leg.html?id=9SdtAAAAMAAJ\n\nMarci Cottingham's studies on gender and healthcare work:\nRECRUITING MEN, CONSTRUCTING MANHOOD:\nHow Health Care Organizations Mobilize Masculinities as Nursing Recruitment Strategy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/km22il7hm9tbbpc/cottingham2013.pdf?dl=0\n\nCaring Moments and Their Men: Masculine Emotion Practice in Nursing: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hxqgm9u0a6i1bic/Cottingham2017.pdf?dl=0\n\nGender and emotion : social psychological perspectives / edited by Agneta H.

I had a lot of scrap hardwood flooring from our home renovations, so I found some really beautiful pieces and got to work.\nMost of the sword is made from left over cumaru teak flooring that I recently used in our house. It has a really beautiful grain pattern and some elegant figuring, plus it's extremely dense and hard. I had just finished watching Alec Steele's series on making a Damascus steel katana, so I had a rough idea on how the whole thing went together.\n\nFirst, I drew out the rough shape of the blade based on some online dimensions. I cut out this shape on the bandsaw making sure to leave a tang on the bottom that would fit inside the hilt. I rough sanded the blade to give the sword some definition and moved on to the tsuba, or hand guard.\n\nI found another smaller piece of teak flooring for the tsuba. I used some calipers to measure the tang dimensions and transferred those lines to the blank tsuba. I drilled out this space and had to chisel and file the pocket very carefully so that the blade tang would sit snuggly into it. After I had a good fit, Â I cut the tsuba into an oval using a paper template.\n\nAfter researching how katana hilts are wrapped in cotton or silk strips, I decided to recreate that look with an inlayed contrasting wood. I had a piece of scrap oak flooring from my boys' room which would look awesome against the teak hilt. While I worked on other projects, I had my friend Josh CNC out the hilt design and the resulting diamond pattern looked just like a traditional fabric wrap.Â I hogged out the inside of the hilt to receive the tang and once I got a snug fit, it was time to assemble the major components.\n\nThe tsuba fit onto the tang and the tang fit into the hilt. I added a kashira or pommel to the end of the hilt and it was all done. I finished the katana with some linseed oil and beeswax polish and it looks gorgeous! I am so happy to have my own sword and I feel like a true samurai!\n\nIf you liked this woodworking prop, check out the playlist above for more!",26

Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet, known as the Soul Flyers, caught up with and flew into a plane in mid-air.Â \n\nAs part of their project A Door in the Sky, which they had spent several months training for by completing more than 100 test flights in Empuriabrava in Spain, the duo B.A.S.E jumped from the top of the Jungfrau, one of Europeâ€™s highest mountains, and flew into a Pilatus Porter light aircraft in mid-air. Now that's a different way to catch a flight.\n_\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

Following the announcement of the big four categories, the Recording Academy revealed the rest of the nominees online. Jay Z leads the pack with 8 nominations this year including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rap Album. Kendrick Lamar follows with 7 noms including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rap Album. Bruno Mars is next in line with 6 nominations and SZA is the most nominated female with five.\n\nJoining Jay Z and Kendrick in the Album of the Year category is Childish Gambinoâ€™s â€œAwaken, My Love!â€, Lordeâ€™s â€œMelodramaâ€, and Bruno Mars â€œ24k Magicâ€. Record of the Year continues the male-heavy theme with this years nominees Jay Z â€œThe Story of OJâ€, â€œKendrick Lamar â€œHumbleâ€, Bruno Mars â€œ24k Magicâ€, Childish Gambinoâ€™s â€œRedboneâ€, and Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber for â€œDespacitoâ€. The unstoppable â€œDespacitoâ€ trio are also nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop/ Duo Group Performance giving Justin 3 Grammy nominations.\n\nJoining â€œDespacitoâ€ for Song of the Year which celebrates songwriters are Jay Zâ€™s â€œ4:44â€, Julia Michaels â€œIssuesâ€, Logicâ€™s â€œ1-800-273-8255â€, and Bruno Mars â€œThatâ€™s What I Likeâ€. In the coveted Best New Artist category weâ€™ve got Alessia Cara, Khalid, Lil Uzi Vert, Julia Michaels, and SZA are all up for the award. Youâ€™ll see more familiar names in the Best Pop Solo Performance which includes Kelly Clarksonâ€™s â€œLove So Softâ€, Keshaâ€™s â€œPrayingâ€, Lady Gagaâ€™s â€œMillion Reasonsâ€, Pink â€œWhat About Usâ€, and Ed Sheeran â€œShape of Youâ€. \n\nIf you were counting on seeing Taylor Swiftâ€™s â€œReputationâ€ on the noms list, rest assured the eligibility period for the 2018 Grammys was October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. â€œLook What You Made Me Doâ€ was released in August so itâ€™s eligible for this year but the rest of Taylorâ€™s â€œReputationâ€ album will be eligible for the 2019 show. However, Taylor did snag two noms this year including her Best Song Written for Visual Media for her Fifty Shades Darker song â€œI Donâ€™t Wanna Live Foreverâ€ and as a songwriter for Best Country Song in Little Big Townâ€™s â€œBetter Manâ€. \n\nWe gotta say, weâ€™re surprised that we donâ€™t see Ed Sheeranâ€™s name a little more here, and where is Harry Styles? The Grammys will air live from Madison Square Garden in NYC on Sunday January 28th. So what is your first REACTION to the Grammy noms? Get to typing in the comments below!

"Occurred on: November 18, 2017 / Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada\n\nMy husband was leaving the pool and heard a really loud and continuous car horn coming from the parking lot.  At first he though there was a person sitting in the front seat of the car leaning on the horn, but as he got closer he realized it was a dog.  He started filming and as he got closer he could see the dog's paw pushing on the horn.  He stopped filming and tried to distract the dog to get him to take his paw off the horn, which the dog eventually did.\n\nTO SEE THE HOTTEST VIRAL VIDEOS DAILY...\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/A0gBKk\nLike us on Facebook: https://goo.gl/XQWqJt\nFollow us on Instagram: https://goo.gl/NMq8dl\nFollow us on Twitter: https://goo.gl/pF8Xop\n\nViralHog is the resource for the best viral content.  \nSubmit your own great video and make money: https://goo.gl/yejGkm\n\nContact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video.",15

"In Theaters January 12, 2018\n\n--\n\n Following the worldwide hit â€œPaddington,â€ one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  \n\n While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucyâ€™s hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruberâ€™s antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, itâ€™s up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.\n \n Reuniting many of the original filmâ€™s cast while welcoming those in new roles, â€œPaddington 2â€ stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (â€œDownton Abbeyâ€), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (â€œBlue Jasmineâ€), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (â€œThe Guard,â€ â€œInto the Storm,â€ â€œIn Brugesâ€), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (â€œBilly Elliot,â€ â€œEducating Ritaâ€), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (â€œIrisâ€), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, â€œFranz Kafkaâ€™s Itâ€™s a Wonderful Lifeâ€), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (â€œFour Weddings and a Funeralâ€), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (â€œThe Hollow Crownâ€) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (â€œVera Drakeâ€) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddingtonâ€™s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (â€œPaddington,â€ â€œCome Fly with Me,â€ â€œThe Mighty Booshâ€) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TVâ€™s â€œYonderland,â€ â€œMindhornâ€), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the â€œHarry Potterâ€ films, â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,â€ Oscar nominee for â€œGravityâ€).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupiter.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (â€œTyrannosaur,â€ â€œSubmarineâ€), production designer Gary Williamson (â€œBunny and the Bull,â€ â€œSubmarineâ€), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (â€œWonder Woman,â€ â€œThe Dark Knightâ€), and editor Mark Everson (â€œMindhorn,â€ â€œAlan Partridgeâ€), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (â€œBaby Driverâ€).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Themâ€) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (â€œGravityâ€) and Glen Pratt (â€œBeauty and the Beastâ€).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (â€œAtonementâ€).  \n\n â€œPaddington 2â€ was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, â€œPaddington 2.â€  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com\n\n â€œPaddington 2â€ is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor.\n\nÂ©2017 StudioCanal S.A.S.

"That bench won't be yours forever.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nWhen designing urban spaces, city planners have many competing interests to balance. After all, cities are some of the most diverse places on the planet. They need to be built for a variety of needs.\n\nIn recent years, these competing interests have surfaced conflict over an unlikely interest: purposefully uncomfortable benches. \n\nEnter the New York City MTA. Theyâ€™ve installed 'leaning barsâ€™ to supplement traditional benches & save platform space. But designs like this carry an often invisible cost: they rob citizens of hospitable public space. And the people who experience this cost most directly are those experiencing homelessness.\n\nA few notes of thanks:\n\nFirst to Historian A. Roger Ekirch who kindly got me up to speed on the expansion of streetlights in historic western city districts.\n\nAnother thanks goes to author Veronica Harnish, who outlined some of the pitfalls that people experiencing homelessness face when choosing between sleeping rough or utilizing emergency shelters. You can read her blog here: http://car-living.blogspot.com/\n\nA third thank you goes to the staff at the Unites States Interagency Council on Homelessness â€” they supplied the map in this video, as well as some aggregate statistics of the United States homeless population. Those numbers come from a variety of annual â€˜Point-In-Timeâ€™ counts.

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday November 28th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n1) Kevin Feige teases â€˜finaleâ€™ of MCU with Avengers 4\n\n2) James Cameron Says if â€˜Avatarâ€™ 2 & 3 Flop There Wonâ€™t Be â€˜Avatarâ€™ 4 & 5\n\n3) Opening This Week â€“ The Disaster Artist\n\n4) Russell Crowe Teases Potential Movement on a â€˜Master and Commanderâ€™ Sequel\n\n5) â€˜Lady Birdâ€™ Becomes the Best-Reviewed Movie of All-Time on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nIn a sprawling profile in Vanity Fair about the 10-year anniversary of Marvel Studios, the magazine revealed that after the conclusion of Avengers 4, â€œat least some of the original characters who sit at the center of the billion-dollar Avengers team will be hanging up their capes and shields.â€ Head honcho Kevin Feige also teased whatâ€™s to come after Avengers 4, saying they have about 20 completely different Marvel movies in development, with Avengers 4 acting as the â€œFinaleâ€ to the MCU as we know it. \n\nWhile production has already begun on James Cameronâ€™s Avatar 2 and Avatar 3, the director recently revealed to Vanity Fair that if parts 2 and 3 donâ€™t do well at the box office, then Fox will not move forward on parts 4 and 5. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nIn 2003, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World earned 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Weird, and scored two wins for Best Cinematography and Sound Editing. But against a budget of $150 million, the film only made $212 million at the box office, making its sequel prospects unlikely. Now, 15 years later, Russell Crowe has taken to his Twitter account saying a Master and Commander sequel may actually be happening. \n\nWhile itâ€™s very hard to score a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, itâ€™s not impossible.

"He learns a life lesson at 5:17...\nðŸ˜ƒ SUBSCRIBE â–º http://sub2.omele.to\n\nUsed with permission by Tyler Parr. Learn more at http://omele.to/2jrQVQo.\n\nFilmmaker and actor Tyler Parr offers an affecting dual portrait of two men -- one in normal circumstances and one homeless -- on a journey of self-awareness.\n\nThe first half of the film focuses on Donald, as he deals with a very bad morning. The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\nIronied is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, Ironied has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook â–º http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter â–º http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram â–º http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat â–º http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter â–º http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nðŸŽ¬ Got a film?

"The steps the president has to take to fire a nuke are involved and complicated, but they work to safeguard against accidental launches and miscommunications.\n\nThat said, the entire process could happen in just a few short minutes. The following is a transcription of the animation.\n\nIt can take the US government just minutes to launch a nuclear weapon. Here's how it would work.\n\nThe president has the sole authority to call for a nuclear strike. Once the call is made, a series of critical steps follow.\n\nThe president first meets with top military advisers. The meeting would take place in the Situation Room. If the president is traveling, a call is made on a secure line.\n\nIf the president still wants to go through with the strike, the order is verified. To authenticate the order, a challenge code is read to the president. It's usually two phonetic letters like Delta-Echo.\n\nThe president then receives the biscuit, a laminated card that's always near the president. The biscuit has the matching response to the challenge code.\n\nThe Pentagon then broadcasts an encoded message to missile crews. The message is only about the length of a standard tweet.\n\nIt includes the war plan, Sealed Authentication System or (SAS) codes, and the actual missile launch codes. When the launch crews get the message they open lock safes to obtain the SAS codes. These codes are compared with the SAS codes included in the message.\n\nIf fired from a submarine the captain, executive officer, and two others authenticate the launch order. Fifteen minutes after receiving the order, the missiles could be ready to launch.\n\nIf fired from land, there are 50 missiles controlled by 5 launch crews in different locations. Each crew votes for the launch by turning their keys at the same time.\n\nThere are five different keys, but only two need to be turned to launch the missiles. In this scenario, the missiles could be ready to launch just minutes after the president's order. Once the missiles are launched, there's no turning back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

After the attack, Nola is inspired to create street art that shines a light on the persistent catcalling that women endure each and every day.\n\nInspired by this episode, the show's star, creative team, thought leaders, and NYU students came to together to share their stories and tell the world My Name Isn't...\n\nWatch She's Gotta Have it All on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80117554\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the worldâ€™s leading Internet television network with over 100 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

"This video has a lot of flashing colors.  If you're susceptible to seizures, be careful, please.  Your viewing experience will look significantly better if you manually set your YouTube resolution settings to 1440p or 2160p (for desktop, click the gear icon in the lower right).

I decided to drop out of college to spend time experiencing our bucket list together.\n\nWe are actively looking for a Bone Marrow donor to help Chris win this fight, his last hope to defeat cancer once again.\n\nMy Best Friend is the story of Chris' life. Join us in our journey to document, experience, and inspire all of the amazing things that make life worth living. \n\nChris Betancourt, 19.\n\nChris was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina but moved to California with his Sister, Mom, and Dad around the age of 10. Entering a new school in a completely new state, Chris was nervous. Fortunately, he was able to meet a few life-long friends like Dillon and Vincent, who shared a mutual interest for video games.\n\nChris' life would take a dramatic turn in 5th grade. On Memorial Day, 2009 he would be rushed to the hospital after passing out at the beach. After staying in the ER for 13 hours, Chris was transported to Kaiser Roseville before being officially diagnosed with Chronic Mylogenous Leukemia. After many experimental treatments and a few miserable months in the hospital, Chris was well on the road to recovery and eventually entered remission.\n\nIn Sophomore year of high school, Chris faced another life-altering experience. On the morning of May 4th, 2014 Chris woke up the news that his sister had taken her own life. After many years of emotional chaos caused by such a loss, Chris was able continue life with his head up. He continues to be the happiest person in any room he enters. \n\nAfter successfully graduating from Del Campo Highschool, Chris began setting up his future. Before entering college, he took a year off to work as an electrician and save up money. At this point his father had moved to Florida, his mother to Puerto Rico. Eventually, Chris would be enrolled as a full time student at Sacramento City College where he prepared for his future as an IT professional.\n\nOn September 2nd, 2017 Chris sat down to hear the worst news possible. The cancer cells in his blood jumped from .001% to 11% and had officially returned. This time, the cancer was a new mutated string that is resilient to most of the experimental drugs he had used before. Though difficult to acknowledge, Chris has one year to live.",22

Learn more at http://omele.to/2jrQVQo.\n\nFilmmaker and actor Tyler Lionel Parr offers an affecting dual portrait of two men -- one in normal circumstances and one homeless -- on a journey of self-awareness.\n\nThe first half of the film focuses on Donald, as he deals with a very bad morning. The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\nIronied is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, Ironied has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\nâ–º https://www.tylerparr.com\n\nSong: Iron Pump by Olenka and the Autumn Lovers\nâ–º http://olenkalovers.com/music_oatal.html\nâ–º https://olenkalovers.bandcamp.com/track/iron-pump\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook â–º http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter â–º http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram â–º http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat â–º http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter â–º http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nðŸŽ¬ Got a film?

"Thank you to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring this episode. Learn more about Xfinity Mobile â€“ a new kind of network that combines Americaâ€™s largest most reliable 4G LTE with the most WiFi hotspots. http://bit.ly/XFINITY_MOBILE\n\nMore Celebrity News â–ºâ–º http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nWelp, turns out CBS decided not to edit out model Ming Xi (SHEE)â€™s fall during last nightâ€™s airing of the Victoria Secret fashion show. This episode of Newsfeed is brought to you by Xfinity Mobile. Itâ€™s a new kind of network.\n\nSooo thatâ€™s embarrassingâ€¦\n\nRumor was that CBS would probably edit out Mingâ€™s fall on the catwalk at last weekâ€™s pre-taped Victoria Secret fashion showâ€¦After all, CBS has taken out other awkward flubs at the show in the past, like last year when Ariana Grande got smacked in the face with angel wings. But that was not the case with this tumble.\nYa know why they didnâ€™t cut this out? Because it was TV gold and great publicity. I mean, weâ€™re talking about it right now and so are most media outlets. To amp up the drama further, they sliced in backstage audio from the producers. Check this outâ€¦\n\nItâ€™s truly like a car crash. I donâ€™t want to look, but I have to. My friend and editor at Cosmopolitan, Alex Rees, shares my sentiments, tweetingâ€¦â€omg and she's crying (tbh its a bit f-ed up to air this part imho but then i recorded the footage to share on twitter so i dont really have a point i guess).â€\nIt got even sadder when they show Ming in tears after exiting the runway.\n\nFans have been vocal about their feelings about the final edit of the show on twitter. \n\nOne viewer tweeted, â€œPretty uncool of Victoria's Secret to not only show Ming Xi fall, but then also show her crying backstage.â€\nAnother viewer was annoyed that they didnâ€™t use footage from the dress rehearsal instead writing, â€œThe vsfs is filmed twice. Iâ€™m disgusted that they showed Ming Xi fall, like honestly? Why did they do her like that? They embarrassed her in front of millions of people. Iâ€™m so disappointed in Victoria Secret right now.â€\n\nUgh, poor, Ming. And if you thought it couldnâ€™t be more embarrassingâ€¦the fall happened in front of a hometown crowd in Shanghai. The model wrote this in an Instagram caption following the incident last week. \n\nâ€œIt was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me.â€\n\nI know theyâ€™re supposed to be â€œangels, but am I horrible for saying I appreciated this humanizing moment. We got to see genuine emotion, a fallâ€¦ literally and figuritivelyâ€¦ and a strong recovery. Itâ€™s kind of a hero story for me. What do you think?! Let me know in the comments section below. Iâ€™m your host Ashley Iaconetti, thanks for tuning in to Clevver. \n\nNow click left to see Harry Styles get his grove on the Victoria Secret fashion show.

"Jimmy had an interesting day that led to being in a Twitter war with judge and Senate hopeful Roy Moore who has recently been accused by many women of hitting on them, groping them and more before they were 18 years old. Roy is not happy with Jimmy because our friend Jake Byrd showed up at his rally last night. Apparently, there was an incident and Jake was kicked out. So, Roy invited Jimmy to Alabama via twitter to discuss their issues 'man to man.'

"MIDNIGHT SUN is a romantic tearjerker about 17-year-old Katie Price (Bella Thorne), sheltered at home since childhood with a rare genetic condition, a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight.  Having only her father Jack (Rob Riggle) for company, Katie's world opens up after dark when she ventures outside to play her guitar.  One night, her dreams come true when sheâ€™s noticed and asked out by her longtime crush Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger), whom sheâ€™s secretly watched from her bedroom window for years.  As they embark on nightly summer excursions, Katieâ€™s risk to sunlight grows and sheâ€™s presented with the gut-wrenching dilemma of whether she can live a normal life with her newfound soul mate.",24
"Hint: single-payer wonâ€™t fix Americaâ€™s health care spending.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAmericans don't drive up the price by consuming more health care. They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:\nhttp://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/\n\nBut the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:\nhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf\n\nThe price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.\n\nThat's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.\n\nThere are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.\n\nUninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.\n\nFor more health care policy content, check out The Impact, a podcast about the human consequences of policy-making.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-impact/id1294325824?mt=2\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"What was glorious Technicolor? It was a groundbreaking technology â€” but it was more than that, too.\n\nFind an extra commentary video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJCtHs-dh0M\n\nTo learn more, check out:\nThe George Eastman Museum: https://eastman.org/\nBarbara Flueckiger's website: http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/\n\nFollow Phil Edwards on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/philedwardsinc1/\n\nIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history of Technicolor: both the technology and the company. Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.\n\nBut Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company â€” and viewers â€” demanded.\n\nThough the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"*regular video soon*\nThis video was made for YT's Creators for Change program. After receiving comments about being in interracial relationships over the years, I finally felt comfortable enough to address and unpack why these comments always caused a lot of discomfort- more than the usual hate comments. \nThis is a very surface start to what is such a large conversation but I hope to revisit the topic later in more depth. There are opinions in here I agree with, opinions I disagree with, and I voice opinions that might change in the future. \n\nThank you to everyone who helped contribute to this. It's an uncomfortable topic and your willingness to help means a lot.\nIf you have any thoughts, preferably not any abusive ones, it would be great to hear them. \nThanks for watching and hope you're well.

"Space is the final frontier. Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, itâ€™s up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! â–º http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe â—„\nStay updated â–º http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos â—„ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isnâ€™t really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldnâ€™t it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earthsâ€™ gravity holding down your body, you could end up with â€œspace sicknessâ€, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. Youâ€™ll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space.",24
"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: Iâ€™m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. Itâ€™s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity â€” a neutron star, a black hole â€” and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel â€” to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really â€¦ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole â€” put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey â€” then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel â€” through this wormhole â€” you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",28

"Brazilian professional surfer Pedro â€œScoobyâ€ Vianna takes an epic spill from his board during a storm in NazarÃ©, Portugal. By February 28, Scooby was tearing down the tide at 45 miles an hour on his rattling surfboard. There was a 70-foot mountain of water avalanching behind him.\n\nThe seething spume nipped him from behind and sent him bombing into the fray in a violent back flop.\n\nScoobyâ€™s friend and fellow Brazilian, Lucas Chumbo Chianca, rode in on a jet ski to pick him up before the next monster set rolled in. Scooby grabbed ahold of a rear tow board latched to the jet ski, and they sped away in an attempt to outrun the next wave. Chumbo soon lost control in the choppy whitewater, and the jet ski capsized near some dangerous rocks. Another massive wave was right behind them. \nTwo people now needed a rescue. \nHow did Scooby and Chumbo finally escape the chaos? Everaldo Pato Teixeira, a veteran big wave surfer from Brazil, tore in on yet another jet ski. In a deft and coolheaded rescue bolstered by years of experience, Teixeira rescued Chumbo and Scooby, both of whom were relatively unscathed.\n\nThis episode ended well and became one of the main highlights of the Big Wave Season, the drone video went viral after it was used on a Red Bull Production and later licensed to National Geographic, reaching 20 million views in few days, dozens of media outlets picked up the story, the footage is currently being licensed for several feature documentaries across the globe, and is now perhaps the most viewed piece of footage of NazarÃ©.\n\n** The Big Ugly was an Official Nominee for the Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition, featured on VICE/Motherboard.\n\n*** UPDATE (Dec 3, 2017): The Big Ugly is the Winner of the News & Documentary Award on the #LADFF Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition\n----------\n\nCopyright Â© 2017, MÃ¡quina Voadora, all rights reserved\nFilmed and Edited by: MÃ¡quina Voadora\nFeatured Surfers: Pedro Scooby, Lucas Chumbo, Everaldo Pato Teixeira\nMusic: Drive by Ross Bugden (https://youtu.be/3pZdZiPnsGs) \nLocation: Praia do Norte, NazarÃ© - Portugal\n__________________________\nThe footage in this video is protected by copyright.

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, December 2nd 2017) John takes the following user submitted topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nÅ Ã¡rka VajnerovÃ¡ - Hi John, i dare you pronounce my name correctly. I am fan  from Czech Republic. I grew up watching 90Â´s X-Men cartoon and i loved it. I like X-Men movies but i was really disappointed in the portrayal of my favourite character, Gambit. I was looking forward for his solo movie. But I don't hear any news anymore. ItÂ´s that movie still happening or not?\n\nJessica Kang - I wanted to know your thoughts on the upcoming Lucille Ball biopic.  As a HUGE Lucille Ball fan, it amazes me that they havenâ€™t done a proper biopic on her yet.  She had such a fascinating life and I would love to see the backstage drama told without any sugarcoat.  Love your insight and your logic and of course, keep bringing on the filthy!\n\nTaylor Pechter - I've watched the Inifinty War trailer a few times. I enjoyed it, but one thing gave me pause. At the end of the trailer, you have The Avengers running at another army of faceless, canon-fodder monsters. Do you think this is the climax? I hope not because this has been a trope ever since the first Avengers and is kind of becoming tiresome. What do you think? \n\nAlijah Brown - Hey John deadpool 2 will definitely be a smash hit next year or at least that's what I assume. How do you think the film will hold up against a super blockbuster like Infinity war. 2018 is certainly packed with comic book movies. A lot of competition. Your thoughts?\n\nRoger Daultry - There are reports that Bryan Singer has gone awol several times during the shooting of the Queen Biopic and Fox has just halted production because of Singerâ€™s â€œunexpected unavailabilityâ€. His publicist put out a statement that itâ€™s because of a family health matter. My question is: Do you believe him or is there a deeper problem happening here? I really want a great Queen movie!",24

"Brazilian professional surfer Pedro â€œScoobyâ€ Vianna takes an epic spill from his board during a storm in NazarÃ©, Portugal. By February 28, Scooby was tearing down the tide at 45 miles an hour on his rattling surfboard. There was a 70-foot mountain of water avalanching behind him.\n\nThe seething spume nipped him from behind and sent him bombing into the fray in a violent back flop.\n\nScoobyâ€™s friend and fellow Brazilian, Lucas Chumbo Chianca, rode in on a jet ski to pick him up before the next monster set rolled in. Scooby grabbed ahold of a rear tow board latched to the jet ski, and they sped away in an attempt to outrun the next wave. Chumbo soon lost control in the choppy whitewater, and the jet ski capsized near some dangerous rocks. Another massive wave was right behind them. \nTwo people now needed a rescue. \nHow did Scooby and Chumbo finally escape the chaos? Everaldo Pato Teixeira, a veteran big wave surfer from Brazil, tore in on yet another jet ski. In a deft and coolheaded rescue bolstered by years of experience, Teixeira rescued Chumbo and Scooby, both of whom were relatively unscathed.\n\nThis episode ended well and became one of the main highlights of the Big Wave Season, the drone video went viral after it was used on a Red Bull Production and later licensed to National Geographic, reaching 20 million views in few days, dozens of media outlets picked up the story, the footage is currently being licensed for several feature documentaries across the globe, and is now perhaps the most viewed piece of footage of NazarÃ©.\n\n** The Big Ugly was an Official Nominee for the Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition, featured on VICE/Motherboard.\n\n*** UPDATE (Dec 3, 2017): The Big Ugly is the Winner of the News & Documentary Award on the #LADFF Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition\n----------\n\nCopyright Â© 2017, MÃ¡quina Voadora, all rights reserved\nFilmed and Edited by: MÃ¡quina Voadora\nFeatured Surfers: Pedro Scooby, Lucas Chumbo, Everaldo Pato Teixeira\nMusic: Drive by Ross Bugden (https://youtu.be/3pZdZiPnsGs) \nLocation: Praia do Norte, NazarÃ© - Portugal\n__________________________\nThe footage in this video is protected by copyright.

"Hello everybody to another car commercial of the past! Here today, we have a unique car commercial for you guys. A commercial that features the Pontiac lineup for 1991, with the voice of Patrick Stewart narrating over the commercial! Some of the vehicles featured in this commercial are already talked about in my other car commercial videos like the LeMans and Bonneville, so I'll talk about the Pontiac Grand Prix featured in this commercial. \n\nThe Grand Prix had a base 3.1 Liter, 6 cylinder engine that produced 140 horsepower at 4400 RPM with 185 LB-FT of Torque at 3200 RPM. A more powerful 3.4 Liter V6 that produced 210 Horsepower was available as an option.\n\nThe base transmission  on the Grand Prix was a 3 speed automatic, with a 4 speed automatic and 5 speed manual being available as options. Fuel mileage with the optional 4 speed automatic was a decent 17 MPG city, 28 MPG highway. \n\nTwo body styles were offered on the Grand Prix; a 2 door coupe or 4 door sedan. The GT model trim only came in a 2 door coupe.\n \nThree trim levels were offered on the Grand Prix; the LE base trim, the SE mid range trim, the more luxurious STE model trim, and the sport oriented GT trim. The MSRP for the LE entry level trim in a 4 door sedan layout was $14,779, the MSRP for the SE mid range trim was $15,769, the MSRP for the luxury STE model trim in a 4 door layout was $20,479 and the MSRP for the 2 door GT coupe was $19,369.\n\nIf you wanted a modestly priced sport oriented 2 and 4 door vehicle that was Domestic, provided somewhat good performance, matched with decent gas mileage and sleek looks in 1991, then the Pontiac Grand Prix was the car for you.\n\nThere are many more old car commercials uploaded on my channel and many more to come, so check my channel often for more videos!\n\n(Disclosure: I do not own this old car advertisement commercial as it belongs to the General Motors Automobile Corporation.)",2

Learn more at http://omele.to/2jrQVQo.\n\nFilmmaker and actor Tyler Lionel Parr offers an affecting dual portrait of two men -- one in normal circumstances and one homeless -- on a journey of self-awareness.\n\nThe first half of the film focuses on Donald, as he deals with a very bad morning. The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\nIronied is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, Ironied has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\nâ–º https://www.tylerparr.com\n\nSong: Iron Pump by Olenka and the Autumn Lovers\nâ–º http://olenkalovers.com/music_oatal.html\nâ–º https://olenkalovers.bandcamp.com/track/iron-pump\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook â–º http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter â–º http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram â–º http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat â–º http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter â–º http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nðŸŽ¬ Got a film?

"Our guest host Tracee Ellis Ross decided that since she had a big platform like this, she wanted to talk about the Hollywood sexual harassment scandal. Over the past two months, countless brave women have come forward to share their experiences and while Tracee isnâ€™t totally surprised by these stories, it seems like quite a few men are. Treating women with respect shouldnâ€™t be complicated but it seems to be a bit confusing for a lot of men. So Tracee wrote a childrenâ€™s book for men to make this real simple for them. #TheHandsyMan\n\nGuest Host Chris Pratt & Chris Stapleton Sing â€œ(Iâ€™ve Had) The Time of My Lifeâ€ https://youtu.be/aw-r_G7rfnU\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nTracee Ellis Rossâ€™ Childrenâ€™s Book for Handsy Men\nhttps://youtu.be/KXRYlfjlFLk",23

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 5th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, John Rocha, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Bryan Singer fired from Bohemian Rhapsody\n\n2) Rian Johnson Talks New â€˜Star Warsâ€™ Trilogy Plans and If Heâ€™ll Direct All Three Films\n\n3) Opening This Week \n\n4) Zachary Levi Says Shazam Could Surprise Like Guardians of the Galaxy\n\n5) James Franco Set to Direct & Star in Shel Silverstein Biopic â€˜A Boy Named Shelâ€™\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as news broke that Fox had halted production on the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, THR is now reporting that director Bryan Singer has been fired from the production. The trade details a long list of reasons that include clashes between him and his Freddie Mercury actor Rami Malek, absences from the set that would force cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel to step in and direct; and actor Tom Hollander, who plays Queen manager Jim Beach, is said to have briefly quit the film because of the directorâ€™s behavior, but was persuaded to return. \n\nWith Star Wars The Last Jedi ready to debut in theatres next Friday, director Rian Johnson is now making the press rounds on the promotional tour. Not surprising, The Last Jedi talk soon turned to his new trilogy of films separate from the Saga, which is said to be a whole new story with characters weâ€™ve yet to meet. Colliderâ€™s own Steve Weintraub spoke to Johnson about the new trilogy and asked if heâ€™d like to direct all three movies.\n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nSpeaking at the recent Heroes & Villains convention in San Jose, CA - Shazam himself, Zachary Levi, talked a bit about the upcoming adaptation, revealing that he thinks the movie could surprise audiences in the same way Marvelâ€™s Guardians of the Galaxy did.\n\nIn a report from Deadline, James Franco is in talks to direct and star in a film about childrenâ€™s book author Shel Silverstein. Writers Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair will pen the adaptation based on Lisa Rogakâ€™s book â€œA Boy Named Shel.â€ Silverstein, a poet, singer, songwriter, and screenwriter, has seen his work translated into more than 30 languages, selling over 20 million copies in total. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Rocha: https://twitter.com/TheRochaSays\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom â€” and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summerâ€™s events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dadâ€™s footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdaleâ€™s young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. Itâ€™s all weighing heavily on Archieâ€™s mind â€” as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but sheâ€™s not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Bettyâ€™s nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (MÃ¤dchen Amick), arenâ€™t the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), thereâ€™s an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesnâ€™t want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then thereâ€™s Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdaleâ€™s Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œGleeâ€), Greg Berlanti (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€), Sarah Schechter (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrow, Dynasty, Valor, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Black Lightning, and Life Sentence.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Mad World | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",24
"In Samut Songkhram, about an hour outside Bangkok, is Maeklong Railway Market, one of the largest produce and seafood markets in Thailand. But beyond the selection of fresh fruit and fish, the market has become infamous for one thingâ€”the train that runs directly through it. In 1905, the Maeklong Railway built a commuter train line through the center of the popular market. But rather than move, the vendors adapted to the new conditions, working around the train that passes through eight times a day, seven days a week.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Flavors series, where we do so much more than play with our food.

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, December 5th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nJerry Montgomery - I was one of the people who got frustrated at the Frozen short that played before Coco. Loved Coco, and the short wasnâ€™t bad, but at north of 20 minutes long it just made for a lot longer evening for the kids than I was banking on. Did Disney actually hear the complaints and pull it from the screenings?\n\nHussain Shah - Hi John, congrats on 100,000 subs just waiting for the other 900,000 to find your fantastic channel. I'm wondering your thoughts on Netflix's Oscar chances? Do you feel they'll have a chance or do the academy just have a prejudice against online streaming? They're releasing a film a week next year, surely one will get recognised at least. \n\nVictor - Hi John, awesome show. Super baffled by 20th Century Foxâ€™s decision to fire Bryan Singer from the Bohemian Rhapsody movie - especially after reading Singerâ€™s comments about needing time for family health issues. Is this a smart move by 20th Century Fox? Why not keep him on board in some advisory capacity, whilst bringing in a co-director who can complete shooting? Something doesnâ€™t add up... Thanks!\n\nZR J-Ro - My question was could Tarintinoâ€™s Star Trek be Rated R since most of, if not not all, of his movies are?\n\nRebecca VanDerween - Iâ€™m seeing a lot of excitement for Avengers Infinity War. The trailer was just amazing. But after the recent choke job of Justice League, should we be nervous that Infinity War could crash and burn like it did? Why should we feel confident that Avengers will work where Justice League failed?",24

"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\nIn Theaters June 22, 2018 \n\nhttps://www.jurassicworld.com\n\nItâ€™s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment.  Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.\n\nWhen the islandâ€™s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor whoâ€™s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaursâ€”along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles.\n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic Worldâ€™s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly.  Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment.  BelÃ©n Atienza joins the team as a producer.",24

The impact was a climactic event that likely contributed to dinosaur extinction. Today, Earth remains vulnerable to asteroid collisions. In recent history, space rocks have landed in The United States, Russia, and elsewhere. In the event of a potential asteroid collision, NASA has developed several options for dealing with the threat. Researchers at NASAâ€™s Center for Near Earth Object Studies and Jet Propulsion Laboratory have proposed using blunt force, weaponized deflection or a theoretical tool called a gravity tractor to deflect impact. In addition to developing contingency plans, NASA scientists are also searching the sky for future asteroid threats.

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da! See ya, big guy!\nI cannot believe that it worked, but it worked, and I honestly do not know why\nIf I hurry away before they even know I've fled I\nwill be well on my way or at least one step closer to having a chance to become \nthe second-to-last Jediiiiii!\nAnd you'll drop your weapon. \n(he does)\nYes!\n\n** THANKS FOR WATCHING! :) **\n\nIf you made it all the way to here, comment I hope Daisy Ridley sees this below!",23

"DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would not accept any Brexit deal that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nHer party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson claimed Brussels has been trying to bounce the prime minister into acceding to the shape of a deal they want and many of her own backbenchers would not accept it.\nHe said the DUP objected to the form of words used in a draft document, which he said referred to regulatory alignment and no regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the EU.\nBoth phrases were simply EU speak for keeping Northern Ireland in the European market and in effect, part of the United Kingdom would be kept within the single market, he said.\n\nPlease subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nWorld In Pictures https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBX37n4R0UGJN-TLiQOm7ZTP\nBig Hitters https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBUME-LUrFkDwFmiEc3jwMXP\nJust Good News https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS3XGZxi7cBUsYo_P26cjihXLN-k3w246",25

"http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure â€œReady Player One,â€ based on Ernest Clineâ€™s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon. \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. \n\nâ€œReady Player Oneâ€ stars Tye Sheridan (â€œX-Men: Apocalypse,â€ â€œMudâ€), Olivia Cooke (â€œMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,â€ â€œBates Motelâ€), Ben Mendelsohn (â€œRogue One â€“ A Star Wars Story,â€ â€œBloodlineâ€) and T.J. Miller (â€œDeadpool,â€ â€œSilicon Valleyâ€), with Simon Pegg (the â€œStar Trekâ€ movies, the â€œMission: Impossibleâ€ movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (â€œBridge of Spies,â€ upcoming â€œDunkirkâ€). \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (â€œSchindlerâ€™s List,â€ â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€) reunited his creative team from â€œBridge of Spies,â€ including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (â€œSchindlerâ€™s List,â€ â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (â€œThe Grand Budapest Hotelâ€), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (â€œSaving Private Ryan,â€ â€œRaiders of the Lost Arkâ€) and Sarah Broshar (â€œThe Postâ€), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (â€œMoonrise Kingdomâ€).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the â€œBack to the Futureâ€ films, â€œForrest Gumpâ€).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, â€œReady Player One.â€\n\nSlated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",24

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, December 9th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nPATREON Supporter Jacob Bullard - Do you think Tarantino's association, regardless of the film's quality, will hamper the next Trek film's financial success? Django (Tarantinoâ€™s record) made $425mil. I fear many people, especially families, will avoid it because of assumptions drawn from Tarantino's past films. Even the general audience knows his movies are more extreme than average R-rated films. \n\nMathew Garet - Kind of a random question, do you find it as odd as I do that, JA Bayona isn't the one announcing trailers on social media, but it was actually Colin Trevorrow? Appreciate everything you do John! \n\nSamuel Polay - I just watched the trailer for Alita battle angel and my reaction can be summed in one word: disturbed. How did nobody at the studio notice these effects on Alita and immediately mandate reshoots that use just the actress' real face instead of this uncanny valley monstrosity? \n\nSebastian Dietz - Hey John, like always greetings from germany ;) in my opinion one of the first things disney should do after buying foxâ€˜s assets is split the production auf Avatar 2 and 3. (Yes iâ€™m in the doubting J. Cameron business ;)) If Avatar 2 fails (and i think there are huge arguments that it could) itâ€™s a big risk to already have spend the money on the production of the 3rd one. Much like the situation of JL and Aquaman. Thoughts?\nBryan K - If DC and WB offered Kevin Feige a huge pay bump to jump ship to build their DCU do you think Kevin would go and would you want him to? Kevin has already done so much for Marvel he may won't a new challenge and fresh start?\n\n**DC logo art by Piebytwo",24

"The new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/\nClick show more to learn about the video, deck, music and moves!\n\nA note from The Virts about RISE:\n\nIf thereâ€™s one thing weâ€™ve learned from shuffling cards over the past 14 years, itâ€™s that you only get better at Cardistry as you repeatedly push yourself beyond your limits. The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.\n\nToday, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better weâ€™ve gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating. \n\nOver the years, weâ€™ve come to establish a bit of a love-hate relationship with failure. We still donâ€™t like it, yet weâ€™ve also come to recognize that if weâ€™re not dropping our cards enough, weâ€™re also not going to get any better at Cardistry. And in that sense, weâ€™ve come to find failure rather beautiful. \n\nRISE was birthed from a vision of ours to capture this intriguing beauty of failure.\n\nEnvisioning a juxtaposition between clean forms and abstract swirls, we pictured cards being manipulated with impeccable technique - abruptly interrupted and exploding out of the very hands that shuffled them. \n\nWe imagined them rising from the ground; the cards fluttering through the air in slow motion, dancing like the leaves in the Fall... and returning to our hands - perhaps forming imperfectly at first, then progressing with each step taken, and finally, displayed in all their glory. \n\nYet our stubbornness as Cardists doubling as filmmakers resulted in a few interesting restrictions that we imposed upon ourselves: \n\nIf this â€œFallâ€ vision were to be captured, it would have to be done with no CG. Everything had to be filmed in-camera and performed by ourselves with with a real deck of cards.\n\nNext, there would be no use of green screen, compositing, or other camera trickery. The furthest we agreed upon was the reversal of several scenes - and only if they genuinely added to the story we wanted to tell. \n\nAnd finally, the cards used could not be gimmicked in anyway - no strings, magnets or anything of the sort. If what we envisioned could not be accomplished by our technique, then the idea was scrapped. \n\nThankfully, after months of planning, testing, and of course...failing, we finally had the opportunity to transform our vision into a reality. \n\nThrough the use of a Phantom high-speed camera mounted on a Bolt Cinebot (thank you Shooting Gallery Asia), and the help of a leaf blower or two... Rise was born. \n\nWe truly hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it for you. \n\n- The Virts\n\n---\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck\nCredits:\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nCardistry Credits:\nCardistry performed by Virtuoso (The Virts):\nHuron Low \nKevin Ho \nDaren Yeow\n\nCardistry and Card flourish move list (in order shown):\n \nIndice Fans (classic)\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nStairmaster by Kevin Ho (credit to Birger Karlsson and Kenneth Aidan Foo)\nNinja Spring Grab + Replacement by Virtuoso\nFlicker by Huron Low  + Rev 2 Twirl by Daren Yeow\nFlicker Shot Behind the Back by Huron Low\nV Cascade by Daren Yeow\nAerial Combo Sequence by Huron Low (Kick Cut Flip, V Flip, by Huron Low, Railslide Flip, Aerial Cut by Dan and Dave Buck)\nBuzzsaw by Brendan Conner\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nMind Eraser by Kevin Ho (credit to Chris Kenner and Huron Low)\nSatellite by Kevin Ho\nTornado Deck Split by Kevin Ho (credit to Bone Ho)\nPiano Cuts by Andrew Avila\nYo! variation by Daren Yeow (credit to Lee Asher)\nWaterwheel by Huron Low, Daren Yeow, and Elijah Cai\nIndice Fans (classic)\n\nVideo credits:\nDirector: Huron Low of Virtuoso\nDirector of Photography: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nVideo Editor: Daren Yeow of Virtuoso\nLighting by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nColor Grading by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nCrew: The Shooting Gallery Asia\nWardrobe Styling by: Shu Juang\n\nMusic Credits:\nMusic: Rise by Virtuoso \nMusic composed and produced by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio Post and Sound Design by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio samples from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins \n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nThe Shooting Gallery Asia: Seb Tan and his amazing team (shout out to Ahmad Rafa'ie!) for making this #Cardistry shoot possible. \nhttps://www.shootinggalleryasia.com/\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck by #thevirts\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nThe new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/",24

It's basically a grid type shockwave that results in a star shaped shockwave! So cool!\n\n At the time he only had an old Casio camera for slow motion, but it was just enough to be able to barely see this effect.

"http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure â€œReady Player One,â€ based on Ernest Clineâ€™s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\nâ€œReady Player Oneâ€ stars Tye Sheridan (â€œX-Men: Apocalypse,â€ â€œMudâ€), Olivia Cooke (â€œMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,â€ â€œBates Motelâ€), Ben Mendelsohn (â€œRogue One â€“ A Star Wars Story,â€ â€œBloodlineâ€) and T.J. Miller (â€œDeadpool,â€ â€œSilicon Valleyâ€), with Simon Pegg (the â€œStar Trekâ€ movies, the â€œMission: Impossibleâ€ movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (â€œBridge of Spies,â€ â€œDunkirkâ€).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (â€œSchindlerâ€™s List,â€ â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€) reunited his creative team from â€œBridge of Spies,â€ including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (â€œSchindlerâ€™s List,â€ â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (â€œThe Grand Budapest Hotelâ€), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (â€œSaving Private Ryan,â€ â€œRaiders of the Lost Arkâ€) and Sarah Broshar (â€œThe Postâ€), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (â€œMoonrise Kingdomâ€).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the â€œBack to the Futureâ€ films, â€œForrest Gumpâ€).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, â€œReady Player One.â€\n\nSlated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",24
"Jimmyâ€™s baby Billy had his second open heart surgery last week so Jimmy had guest hosts fill in for him while he was out. Thankfully the surgery was a success and Jimmy returned to the show tonight with Billy in tow to show everyone how well he is doing. Jimmy thanks the bright and talented doctors and nurses at Childrenâ€™s Hospital LA. He has to have one more surgery when he is around six years old and then he is good to go. However, the fight is not over for millions of children whose health is threatened right now because a program called CHIP (Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program), that is there to protect them, is in serious need of funding because Congress recently failed to approve funding for it. This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans have always overwhelmingly supported it â€“ until now. Now itâ€™s being used as a bargaining chip. So Jimmy is encouraging everyone to call the House and Senate at (202) 225-3121 to tell them to take a break from tax cuts and fully fund CHIP now. Also, if you donâ€™t have health insurance make sure to go to healthcare.gov and sign up before the December 15th deadline. #FundCHIPNow\n\nMelissa McCarthy vs. Jennifer Aniston â€“ The Great Gravity Debate https://youtu.be/ncHhjUllA7s\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Returns with Baby Billy After Heart Surgery\nhttps://youtu.be/yqulWPljawo",23

"The European Space Agency offered me a seat on their zero-g plane: it's an Airbus A310 that flies parabolic maneuvers, pulling up into the sky and then arcing back down, giving its passengers about 20 seconds of weightlessness (or microgravity) at a time. Here's how it works.\n\nSome people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.\n\n**\n\nIf you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...\n\n**\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.\n\nWhy's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.\n\nWhat stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.\n\nWhat did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!\n\n**\n\nCamera: Melanie Cowan\n\nThank you to everyone at ESA and Novespace who helped make this happen!\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo",27

"Over the past year, the price of a Bitcoin has skyrocketed from less than $800 to nearly $20,000 â€” a meteoric rise that financial insiders say is no different than the escalating cost of a tulip in seventeenth-century Amsterdam.\n\nIs it a bubble? Who cares! As VICE News' Jay Kang told us, â€œItâ€™s impossible right now toÂ notÂ get rich if you own any Bitcoin.â€\n\nKang first got the Bitcoin bug in July, initially investing $4000, upping it to $9000, then fearing a crash, betting his entire crypto-cache on a random soccer game (which he lost). A former aspiring professional poker player, Kang bounced back undeterred, and with the surging price of the currency, Bitcoin mania has taken over his life. He claims 10 percent of his net worth is now invested in cryptocurrency.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",25

"The tragedy in Newtown 5 years ago and the countless lives lost in mass shootings since have weighed heavily on my heart. I felt compelled to write â€œThe Dreaming Kindâ€ for the incredible people at Sandy Hook Promise who work so hard every day to combat gun violence. The extraordinary work this organization does to educate and protect our nation from further bloodshed gives me hope for a better tomorrow. I hope this song will inspire the same feeling in those who hear it.\n\nSandy Hook Promise is a national nonprofit organization founded and led by several families whose loved ones were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.\n \nIn just 3 years, Sandy Hook Promise has trained over 2.5 million youth and adults across all 50 states with its evidenced-based Know The Signs gun violence prevention programs. The four programs â€“ which include Start With Hello, Say Something, Signs of Suicide and Safety Assessment & Intervention - are offered free to schools and youth organizations across the country. These programs have helped stop multiple school shootings, suicides and other acts of violence, as well as reduced incidences of bullying and helped many young people get the mental health services they need.  \n\nEvery $1 you donate helps Sandy Hook Promise train one student or adult how to Know The Signs of individuals at-risk of hurting themselves or others and take action to get help. By training two-generations of Americans, we are creating a culture engaged in preventing gun violence,  resulting in saving more lives and keeping our schools and communities safe, nationwide.  \n\nThank you so much for your support,\n\nSheryl\n\nHelp Prevent Gun Violence\nLearn how & donate at  sandyhookpromise.org",10

"Biology is the subject that studies life in all its forms, from the simple cell through to all the animals that inhabit the planet. In this map I lay out the subject of biology and how all of the sub-disciplines are related to each other: microbiology, genetics, bioengineering, anatomy, physiology, medicine, neuroscience, ecology, zoology to name but a few.\n\nBiology spans the scales, from biophysics and biochemistry studying the basic elements of life, to the study of whole ecosystems and the environment. If there is one word that describes biology, it is complexity. There is a huge amount we still donâ€™t understand about how life works, how it started and how it ended up with us.\n\nPOSTERS: If you would like to buy a poster of this map, they are available here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\n \nI have also made a version available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/?\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.

"From Clint Eastwood comes The 15:17 to Paris - in theaters February 9.\n\nhttp://www.1517toparis.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1517toparis\nhttps://twitter.com/1517toParis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/1517toparis\n\n--\n\nFrom Clint Eastwood comes â€œThe 15:17 to Paris,â€ which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.\n\nIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Parisâ€”an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friendsâ€™ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (â€œHall Pass,â€ TVâ€™s â€œThe Officeâ€); Judy Greer (â€œWar for the Planet of the Apesâ€); Ray Corasani (TVâ€™s upcoming â€œThe Long Road Homeâ€); PJ Byrne (â€œThe Wolf of Wall Streetâ€); Tony Hale (TVâ€™s â€œVeepâ€); and Thomas Lennon (â€œTransformers: Age of Extinctionâ€).  Paul-MikÃ©l Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (â€œSully,â€ â€œAmerican Sniperâ€) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The filmâ€™s executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwoodâ€™s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwoodâ€™s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut â€œSully,â€ and that filmâ€™s composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in â€œSullyâ€ and in â€œDunkirk,â€ serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, â€œThe 15:17 to Paris.â€  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",24

In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour â€“ aka Chief Jim Hopper â€“ revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably wonâ€™t hit Netflix until 2019! Itâ€™s not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text â€œWhen you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.â€ Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLetâ€™s learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. Itâ€™s becoming so cruel! Anyway, share your thoughts below on what your predictions for season 3 are and your favorite show youâ€™re currently waiting on.

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 12th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Jared Haibon, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Hugh Jackman rules out a return as Wolverine if Disney/Fox merger happens; Disney/Fox deal nears finish line as Comcast withdraws\n\n2) â€˜Creed 2â€™ Lands Director Steven Caple Jr.; Stallone Sits Out This Round\n\n3) Opening This Week â€“ Star Wars the Last Jedi \n\n4) Seth Rogen to Go Dramatic as Walter Cronkite in JFK Assassination Film â€˜Newsflashâ€™\n\n5) â€˜Black Pantherâ€™: New International Trailer Released Online \n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety has updated the status of the proposed Disney/Fox merger and is now reporting that the Mouse House has such an inside track on a $60 billion-plus agreement that Comcast has formally exited the deal. While implications for the merger remain foggy, one thing most fans want to see is the Fantastic Four and the X-Men return to the MCU â€“ and especially â€“ if itâ€™s enough to lure Hugh Jackman out of retirement. \n\nVariety reports that MGM and Warner Bros. have hired up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson in Creed 2. It was previously reported that Stallone had considered directing sequel at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, made the decision to find another director and after a lengthy search, both Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nDeadline reports that Seth Rogen has signed on to play legendary CBS newsman Walter Cronkite in the upcoming drama Newsflash, directed by his Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green. The drama takes place on November 22, 1963, the day of President John F. Kennedyâ€™s assassination, unfolding in real time as Cronkite and his producer Don Hewitt attempt to report on one of the biggest news stories in history. \n\nA new international trailer from Japan has landed online for Black Panther and it features even more unseen footage of the advanced weaponry utilized by the people of Wakanda. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Tâ€™Challa, who must stand against a powerful old enemy who reappears after years hidden in order to defend the throne and save his people. Black Panther is the next entry in the MCU and opens in theaters on February 16, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jared: https://twitter.com/haibon_jared\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile. But now I wake up and although I still am living in this weird dreamlike world, I can function and make an impression on the world, despite barely feeling like I'm in it.\n\nIt will be okay! I Promise! Don't give up hope! Practise loving what you can experience!\n\nxxxx",24

During a church's Christmas pageant, a pre-school nativity scene took a turn. One of the sheep decided to re-write the story of Christmas by plucking up the baby Jesus and doing a dance with him. In an attempt to prevent Biblical revisionism, Mary tries to wrest control of the infant, but the undeterred sheep grabs it again.",25

"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom â€” and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summerâ€™s events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dadâ€™s footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdaleâ€™s young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. Itâ€™s all weighing heavily on Archieâ€™s mind â€” as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but sheâ€™s not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Bettyâ€™s nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (MÃ¤dchen Amick), arenâ€™t the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), thereâ€™s an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesnâ€™t want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then thereâ€™s Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdaleâ€™s Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œGleeâ€), Greg Berlanti (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€), Sarah Schechter (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrow, Dynasty, Valor, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Black Lightning, and Life Sentence.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",24

"The â€œSilence Breakersâ€ are outliers. Most assault goes unreported.\n\nSources:\n\nTIMEâ€™s reporting: http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers\nand http://time.com/5052362/time-person-of-the-year-2017-arm-cover\nRAINN statistics: https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system \nEEOC report (PDF): https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/upload/report.pdf \n\nTime magazine named the Silence Breakers its Person of the Year for 2017. These are the women and men who shared their stories of assault, harassment, and hostility and publicly named their alleged abusers. But the story goes beyond the magazineâ€™s cover.\n\nThat elbow in the lower right-hand corner is attached to a young hospital worker from Texas, who anonymously reported her harassment for fear of the negative impact it could have on her and her family. It represents a much larger contingent than the women on the cover: the silence keepers.\n\nSexual harassment and sexual assault are both underreported. A government study by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that about 70 percent of harassment is never reported. The same report aggregated a study that found when people did report harassment, about 75 percent of faced some sort of retaliation for doing so.\n\nThe Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) studied the underlying reasons people donâ€™t report, and, unsurprisingly, the above statistics are connected. According to RAINN, the No. 1 reason people donâ€™t report their abuse and harassment is because theyâ€™re afraid of the repercussions.\n\nTime has made it a point to recognize the courage of the â€œSilence Breakers,â€ but itâ€™s important to remember why their actions were brave: because there are far more people remaining silent, who feel that they donâ€™t have the option of speaking up.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

On the Season Four premiere, Lucious makes his first public appearance after the explosion in Las Vegas, while all members of the Lyon family have their own interests in Lucious regaining his physical and mental faculties. Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning actor, director and producer Forest Whitaker (â€œThe Last King of Scotland,â€ â€œArrival,â€ â€œLee Danielsâ€™ The Butlerâ€) will guest-star in a multi-episode arc on EMPIRE, beginning this fall on FOX. Whitaker will play â€œUncle Eddie,â€ a charismatic music icon and bonafide hitmaker, who gave an unknown Lucious (Terrence Howard) his first radio airplay. Decades later, Eddie steps up for Lucious at a critical moment during his rehabilitation, and a grateful Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) invites him to produce a song in celebration of Empire Entertainmentâ€™s 20th anniversary.\n\nEMPIRE is a powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world of hip-hop music. The show revolves around the Lyon family and their media company, Empire Entertainment. The founder, LUCIOUS LYON (Terrence Howard), is the king of hip-hop, but his company and reign are constantly threatened by his family, including his ex-wife, COOKIE LYON (Taraji P. Henson); his sons, JAMAL (Jussie Smollett), HAKEEM (Bryshere â€œYazzâ€ Gray) and ANDRE (Trai Byers); and a volatile and competitive music industry.\n\nâ€œSanta Babyâ€ ft.

"The U.S. conducted 210 atmospheric nuclear tests between 1945 and 1962, with multiple cameras capturing each event at around 2,400 frames per second. But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.\n \nFor the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the filmsâ€™ content before itâ€™s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.\n \nRead more: https://www.llnl.gov/news/physicist-declassifies-rescued-nuclear-test-films\n\nLLNL Copyright and Reuse Policy: https://www.llnl.gov/copyright-and-reuse\n\nSee the declassified LLNL tests: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",28

"It seemed like the Pittsburgh Steelers won and tight end Jesse James would be the hero with a game-winning touchdown catch in the final minute against the New England Patriots. But if youâ€™ve watched the NFL long enough, you know that a catch is often not a catch.\n\nThe NFLâ€™s oft-criticized catch rule might determine where the AFC championship game is held. In the final seconds of a thrilling game Sunday, James caught a pass just short of the goal line, and as he was going down he crossed the goal line for what looked like a touchdown. In the CBS booth, Tony Romo and Jim Nantz couldnâ€™t figure out why it was taking so long for replay review to confirm it.\n\nhttp://BlurredCulture.com",17

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Satruday, December 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nRT - My question is on how Netflix makes money on their original shows. Do people really subscribe because of Stranger Things or Punisher and will anyone drop out when it's over?  I didn't and I won't. Thanks for taking my question. \n\nPATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hi John greeting from Sweden love your show. My question is: Now that fox Disney deal is done. When do you think Disney/Marvel going to announced the new cast for X-Men. Do you think before 2020 or after. Love do hear your thoughts.\n\nJoshua Martin - With Disney's recent acquisition of Fox properties, namely the X-men/Deadpool and F4, does this give Disney/Marvel more power or leverage to either 1. Renegotiate their deal with Sony (after homecoming 2) to allow more Spiderman characters into the MCU at their control (or simply buy them) or 2. Buy back the rights to Hulk and Namor from Universal?\n\nRene Bernard - Hey John. CNN reported that Star Wars: The Last Jedi became the second largest opening Thursday night movie in history with $45 million dollars. With those numbers, do you still think it wonâ€™t catch The Force Awakens opening weekend box office record?",24

Gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns.  Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan)â€”who hails from a Lower Tier of the great traction city of Londonâ€”finds himself fighting for his own survival after he encounters the dangerous fugitive Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar).

"WHITE PINE, Tenn. - An adorable Nativity scene in an East Tennessee church took a hilarious turn when the little girl playing a sheep decided to play with baby Jesus.\n\nAt the First Baptist Church of White Pine, the kids of their live Nativity scene stole the show, but not for the reason you may think.\n\nWhile the children's choir sang Away In A Manger the scene began to unravel. \n\nThe sheep, played by Tana Benson's little girl, Teegan, got up, took baby Jesus out of the manger and began to play with the doll on stage.\n\nLaughter could be heard from parents and audience members as she continued to play and dance with the doll.\n\nYet, it wasn't until the little girl playing Mary decided to take matters into her own hands and take the doll back.\n\nShe and the sheep struggled for a brief moment, before Mary was able to get the doll back in the manger.\n\nBenson said in her Facebook post, that has since gone viral, that she laughed until she cried.",23

"All Clara (Mackenzie Foy) wants is a key â€“ a one-of-a-kind key that will unlock a box that holds a priceless gift from her late mother. A golden thread, presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyerâ€™s (Morgan Freeman) annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted keyâ€”which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. Itâ€™s there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), a gang of mice and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), to retrieve Claraâ€™s key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world. Starring Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy and featuring a special performance by Misty Copeland, Disneyâ€™s new holiday feature film â€œThe Nutcracker and the Four Realmsâ€ is directed by Lasse HallstrÃ¶m and inspired by E.T.A. Hoffmannâ€™s classic tale.

After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs.

"Calzones are a staple of the pizza-parlor menu, but too often the dish doesn't get the respect it deserves. That's too bad, because the calzone is a near-perfect food: According to Mathieu Palombinoâ€”the owner of Motorino Pizzeria in NYCâ€”these wood-fired pizza pockets allow ingredients to stay ultra-moist and flavorful while cooking inside the oven. Stuffed with a mixture of sweet and spicy sausage, and held together by globs of melted Pecorino Romano cheese, Motorino's calzone is a worthy alternative to a classic pie. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",26
"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Monday December 18th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Delivers Second Largest Opening Ever; Fans Split on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n2) Box Office Report\n\n3) Oscar Isaac in Talks to Voice Gomez Addams in Animated â€˜Addams Familyâ€™ Movie\n\n4) '48 Hrs.' Remake in the Works With 'Good Time' Filmmakers\n\n5) â€˜Laddieâ€™ Trailer: Meet The Man Who Made â€˜Star Warsâ€™ Possible\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi delivered on expectations, debuting over the weekend with the second largest opening of all-time, behind only Star Wars The Force Awakens. With an estimated $220 million, The Last Jedi got off to a strong start on Thursday night with the second largest preview ever with $45 million and became the second film to ever gross over $100 million on opening day. Audiences also gave the film an A CinemaScore, matching the score for Force Awakens, however; the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for Last Jedi is currently 56% vs. a 93% score from critics â€“ with an increasing backlash happening online between those fans who enjoyed the movie and those who did not.  \n\nBOX OFFICE REPORT\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nAccording to a report from The Tracking Board, Oscar Isaac has been cast as the voice of Gomez Addams in the animated The Addams Family movie for Sausage Party director Conrad Vernan. The roles of Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Lurch and Uncle Fester have yet to be filled, apparently because the studio wants to close a deal with Isaac before approaching anyone else.\n\nTHR reports that Benny and Josh Safdie, the brother filmmaking team behind the Robert Pattinson thriller Good Time, will take on a remake of 48 Hrs. for Paramount Pictures. 48 Hrs. is the classic comedy that helped launch the big-screen career of Eddie Murphy, as well as the buddy-cop genre. Murphy and Nick Nolte starred as a convict and cop, who must team up to catch a pair of killers within 48 hours. A release date has not been determined. \n\nStar Wars Underworld found and posted the first trailer for â€˜Laddie,â€ the documentary about Alan Ladd Jr, AKA Laddie, the man at 20th Century Fox who gave George Lucas the greenlight and freedom to make Star Wars back in 1977.  The documentary dives into Ladd as an agent, producer, executive, and studio head, where he worked on movies ranging from Alien to Young Frankenstein to Star Wars over the course of his long, storied career. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

"Gringo â€“ Starring David Oyelowo, Charlize Theron, Joel Edgerton, Amanda Seyfried. Directed by Nash Edgerton. In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth â€” or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\nÂ» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\nÂ» In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the companyâ€™s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (HernÃ¡n Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns heâ€™ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that sheâ€™s having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them heâ€™s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Haroldâ€™s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.\n\nOfficial Site  â€“ www.gringo-movie.com  \n\nGet More from Amazon Studios: \nOfficial site: http://bit.ly/GetMoreAmazonStudios\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosInstagram\n\nAbout Amazon Studios:\nThe goal of Amazon Studios is to turn original stories into great entertainment.\n\nGringo - Official Redband Trailer [HD] | Amazon Studios\nhttps://youtu.be/MnKbM9Zxtn8\n\nAmazon Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AmazonStudios",1

"I used to eat this sandwich at a local spot a little further than where I live now and I've always ALWAYS wanted to tackle this recipe since its a bit of a trek to get there now. It pretty close to the Banh Mi at the restaurant, but maybe a little different since I didnt have any daikon...It might not be an authentic Banh Mi recipe, but the flavors will appease the sweet, sour, and spicy flares you would expect from a solid Banh Mi recipe.

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday, December 19th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) J.J. Abrams Just Pitched His Star Wars: Episode IX to Disney\n\n2) Third â€˜GI Joeâ€™ Gets Official 2020 Release Date; Paramount also dates Micronauts and Dungeons & Dragons\n\n3) Opening This Week â€“ Pitch Perfect 3\n\n4) Director Matthew Vaughn Confirms Talks with DC\n\nâ€œI do love the world of DC, and Iâ€™ve been talking to them at the moment about a few things. Itâ€™s more fun getting involved with franchises when theyâ€™re on the down, because then itâ€™s easier to make a good film. So if I got involved with a few of the superhero films out there that have been disappointing, itâ€™s going to beâ€¦ if I do OK, itâ€™ll probably be better.â€\n\n5) First â€˜Oceanâ€™s 8â€² Trailer \n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as Star Wars The Last Jedi was gearing up to debut in theatres, work on Episode 9 started its journey into pre-production. Via a report from Making Star Wars, during the press conference for the recent Disney/Fox merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed that JJ Abrams would be pitching his Star Wars to the studio on December 15th, the day The Last Jedi hit theatres. Fantha Tracks also revealed that Abramsâ€™ film would be made with the working title â€œBlack Diamond.â€ The working title for Force Awakens was â€œAVCOâ€ and â€œSpace Bearâ€ for Last Jedi. Star Wars Episode 9 is scheduled to hit theatres on December 20th, 2019. \n\nYesterday, Paramount Pictures officially announced plans for a third GI Joe movie and dated it to be released on March 27, 2020. Titled simply GI Joe, the plan for the movie is unknown at this time, as is casting and who will be taking on directing duties. Paramount also dated a feature adaptation of the late â€™70s Mego/Takara toyline Micronauts for Oct. 16, 2020, with J.J. Abramsâ€™ Bad Robot behind the production. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a recent podcast from IGN UK, director Matthew Vaughn confirmed heâ€™s had talks with DC and is interested in helping out the studio after the not-so-stellar performance of Justice League cast more speculation as to what is happening behind closed doors over at DC. \n\nWarner Bros. has released the first Oceanâ€™s 8 trailer for the upcoming spinoff from Steven Soderberghâ€™s Oceanâ€™s trilogy. Hunger Games filmmaker Gary Ross directs the new film, which stars Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooneyâ€™s Danny Ocean. When this film begins sheâ€™s fresh out of prison and assembles a team of her own to pull off a unique heist at the Met Gala. Oceanâ€™s 8 opens in theaters on June 8, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

"A few months back I logged onto Facebook and was greeted by a smiling homeless woman's selfie in front of a tent holding up a cup of coffee. It was captioned good morning. Today, I met Manda at her homeless encampment where she made me a cup of coffee!\n\nMost of the time I meet homeless people in person on the streets or in a homeless shelter. Then we often connect online and become friends. Manda and I became friends online first. I got to know her a little before seeing how she survives homelessness.  I am having a hard time processing it all. Lots of emotions both good and bad right now! \n\nManda is an amazing woman. She is disabled from severe brain trauma, yet because she is high functioning, she falls through the gaps in the safety net. I have been working with her trying to help find a path out of homelessness, but the walls bureaucracy are impossible to break through. \n\nFor all the people that believe homeless people are lazy, I wish they could just spend an hour in Manda's shoes! She works hard to keep her tent camp clean. She works hard getting to treatment and therapy. She works hard every single day trying to survive. And she works extremely hard to stay positive while facing the madness of homelessness each and every day! \n\nWe must get Manda out from under that bridge into housing. Because of her health and being a woman out on the streets, she is extremely vulnerable living outside. If you are connected to social services in Seattle or know anyone that is, please reach out to them and forward Manda's story. I have talked to her social worker. Her health issues are severe, and we need to get this woman inside! \n\nManda vlogs on her Facebook page you can find here https://www.facebook.com/mandycampmom/\n\nIf you'd like to help support her directly this is her GoFundMe page https://www.gofundme.com/4qcfk0o\n\nYou can also find Manda on Twitter https://twitter.com/RicherAmanda\n\n________________________________________________\n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1\n\nInvisible People's website:\n\nhttp://invisiblepeople.tv\n\nSupport Invisible People:\n\nhttps://invisiblepeople.tv/donate\n\nOn Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople\n\nInvisible People's Social Media: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://twitter.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv\n\nMark Horvath's Twitter: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/hardlynormal\n\nAbout Invisible People: \n\nSince its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they're on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.\n\nInvisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can't ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation's most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath â€“ its founder â€“ and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America's homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.\n\nInvisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",29

"In New York City, a new group of dancers keeps the cityâ€™s legendary vogue scene on the map. \n\nVogueing began as an imitation of models in fashion magazines and on runways. It is part communal tradition, part competition, part personal statement. And occasionally it surfaces as a mainstream pop-culture phenomenon, too.

I don't like doing heavy makeup when it's cold outside although I'm not really sure why that is since theoretically my makeup should last longer..ï¼ˆï½¡ï½¥Ð”ï½¥ï½¡ï¼‰??? \n\nI played with shimmery and glittery shadows today as well. I usually prefer matte eyeshadows but since this look is so natural, I had to add some âœ§ãƒ»ï¾Ÿ:* sparkle *:ãƒ»ï¾Ÿâœ§ to the eyes\n\nThroughout summer, I like to use coral blushes across my nose to get the sunkissed effect but when winter comes, I switch to pastel blushes. You know how your face gets flushed when you've been out in the cold for too long? I think pastel blushes capture that perfectly ! in a cute way + without the being cold part (âŽâá·€àº»â€†Ë™Ì«â€†âá·€àº»âŽ)\n\nAre you traveling anywhere this winter?

"How President Trump's Jerusalem announcement upsets the status quo.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians consider Jerusalem as their rightful capital. Jerusalem is home to important holy sites for all the Abrahamic religions, and so it has become a critical bargaining chip in the ongoing discussion between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nPresident Trump's administration announced in 2017 that it would officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and that it planned to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. This would make the U.S. the only country in the world with an embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - there are currently various consulates, but no embassies. The announcement spurred condemnation from various countries, including U.S. allies, and has quickly become a political flashpoint of the Middle East.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nDownload MLB.com Ballpark: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/ballpark\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM",17

"Merry Christmas! Share this Christmas card with someone you love! ðŸ’• â–ºhttp://bit.ly/2BUEGVb\nThis project spells out Merry Christmas in 7,000 dominoes and incorporates various Christmas-related objects including ornaments, Santa, a mistletoe, and Christmas lights :)\n\nWatch my other Christmas domino specials here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0dmj1AovU&list=PLNPDtUHUkSPb-IZVGtuQGkYM5L6aOkevw&index=1\n\nFor a while I've wanted to try building large fancy font freehanded out of dominoes, so I decided to build Merry Christmas in cursive :) I wanted to test my skills in recreating an image out of dominoes by eyeing it. Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! ðŸ˜Š\nâ—YOUTUBERS in dominoes âž¡ï¸ http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\nâ—My BEST domino projects âž¡ï¸ http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\nâ—Video games/movies in dominoes âž¡ï¸ http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

"What would bring together the hyper-competitive people from Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest during the holidays? A good old-fashioned a cappella sing-off, thatâ€™s what. In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of â€œTechapella,â€a showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Googleâ€™s group, â€œGoogapella.â€ Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do â€œsome kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,â€ said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giantâ€™s campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has â€œThe Song Birdsâ€ and Pinterest has â€œthe Pintunesâ€) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and â€œTechapellaâ€ was born. More than 1,500 fans attended the two-night event.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",25

"Opening in theaters and VOD January 12th\n\nDirected by: Trudie Styler\nStarring: Bette Midler, Laverne Cox, Alex Lawther, Abigail Breslin & AnnaSophia Robb\n\nBilly Bloom (Alex Lawther, The Imitation Game) is one-of-a-kind: a fabulous, glitter-bedecked, gender-bending teenager whose razor-sharp wit is matched only his by his outrageous, anything-goes fashion sense. When his glamorous mother (Bette Midler) is forced to send him to live with his straight-laced father (Larry Pine), Billy finds himself a diva-out-of-water at his new ultra-conservative high school. Undaunted by the bullies who donâ€™t understand him, the fearless Billy sets out to make a big statement in his own inimitable way: challenging the schoolâ€™s reigning mean girl (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen.

The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (â€œVera Drakeâ€) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddingtonâ€™s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (â€œPaddington,â€ â€œCome Fly with Me,â€ â€œThe Mighty Booshâ€) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TVâ€™s â€œYonderland,â€ â€œMindhornâ€), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the â€œHarry Potterâ€ films, â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,â€ Oscar nominee for â€œGravityâ€).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupfer.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (â€œTyrannosaur,â€ â€œSubmarineâ€), production designer Gary Williamson (â€œBunny and the Bull,â€ â€œSubmarineâ€), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (â€œWonder Woman,â€ â€œThe Dark Knightâ€), and editor Mark Everson (â€œMindhorn,â€ â€œAlan Partridgeâ€), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (â€œBaby Driverâ€).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Themâ€) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (â€œGravityâ€) and Glen Pratt (â€œBeauty and the Beastâ€).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (â€œAtonementâ€).  \n\n â€œPaddington 2â€ was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, â€œPaddington 2.â€  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com\n\n â€œPaddington 2â€ is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor.\n\nÂ©2017 StudioCanal S.A.S.

Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet her status prevents her from the traditions of noble social standing.  While her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) chases suitors for marriage, Belle is left on the sidelines wondering if she will ever find love.  After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England.",1

"There was Kendall and Drew and Mirandaâ€‹, Chaka and Palomaâ€‹ and Hari and Valentinaâ€‹. A fresh-faced gang of top models and celebrities threw open their powder room doors and revealed their most sacred hair, makeup, and skin rituals for Vogue in 2017. Some are stolen from their mothers, like Priyanka Chopraâ€™s all-natural, homemade lip scrub from India â€‹, and some look, at first glance, just a little bit crazy (see Cassieâ€™s 10-second smoky eye trickâ€‹ or â€‹model Grace Hartzelâ€™s Friday the 13th sheet maskâ€‹). The common denominator? Itâ€™s all in the name of beauty.\n\nThatâ€™s why, to close out the year, weâ€™ve assembled a visual cheat sheet of their greatest hits. There are face misters, jade rollers, moisturizers, and foundations. Contour powders, curl creams, face oils, and concealers. But beyond every product was a brilliant trick worth stealing. A few of our favorites? A dark brown mascara doubles as brow gelâ€‹, â€‹and a rosy lipstick, blended onto the apples of the cheeks, provides the perfect I-just-came-in-from-the-cold flush.\n\nChapped lips are no match for these skilled pros: Just ask Victoriaâ€™s Secret model Josephine Skriverâ€‹, who scrubs her lips with a toothbrush to exfoliate and plump. Other gems worth remembering: Highlighter is the new lipliner, and the best hair serum may not be hair serum at all. â€œI feel like it creates some sort of vibe,â€ says sex columnist and Viceland host Karley Sciortino â€‹of her unconventional go-to product, plucked from a bedroom side table. Anything to get the job doneâ€”because as the legendary Chaka Khan knows, the secret to achieving icon status is simple: â€œAlways look your best.â€\n\nStill havenâ€™t subscribed to Vogue on YouTube? â–ºâ–º http://bit.ly/vogueyoutubesub\n \nABOUT VOGUE\nVogue is the authority on fashion news, culture trends, beauty coverage, videos, celebrity style, and fashion week updates. \n\n45 Beauty Secrets in 5 Minutesâ€”Hereâ€™s Everything We Learned in 2017 | Vogue",26

"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people havenâ€™t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. Itâ€™s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - theyâ€™ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, itâ€™s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes.

"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Wednesday, December 27th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon!  http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nPATREON Supporter Spencer Smothers - Spencer Smothers - Hi John. You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope youâ€™re having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isnâ€™t good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime iâ€™m 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :(",24

"As John was saying in his last video, I think that we don't give ourselves enough opportunities for self reflection, and I think personality tests can help with that, but I also think they imply that there is something overly concrete about the things they are testing, and that no self is carved  in stone. \n\nWe have a SciShow Psych episode about more recent understanding of the failures of personality tests here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN6_K6ALeZI&t=2s\n\nHappy New Year everyone!

"#FiftyShadesFreed\n--\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fiftyshadesmovies\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fiftyshades\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fiftyshadesmovie/\n--\nJamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson return as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades Freed, the climactic chapter based on the worldwide bestselling â€œFifty Shadesâ€ phenomenon.  Bringing to a shocking conclusion events set in motion in 2015 and 2017â€™s blockbuster films that grossed almost $950 million globally, the film arrives for Valentineâ€™s Day 2018.\n \nBelieving they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury.  But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.\n \nAlso returning from prior Fifty Shades entries are Academy AwardÂ® winner Marcia Gay Harden, Eric Johnson, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Jennifer Ehle, Eloise Mumford, Max Martini, Callum Keith Rennie, Bruce Altman and Robinne Lee, who are joined for the first time by Arielle Kebbel and Brant Daugherty.\n \nFifty Shades Freed is directed by Fifty Shades Darkerâ€™s James Foley (Fear, House of Cards) and once again produced by Michael De Luca, Dana Brunetti and Marcus Viscidi, alongside E L James, the creator of the culture-spanning blockbuster series.  The screenplay is by Niall Leonard, based on the novel by James.  www.fiftyshadesmovie.com",24

"Real indigo-dyed clothing is not like the blue you know. Richer than the chemical blues used on most fabrics today, real indigo dye comes from a plant and has a surprising range of qualities: on fabric it is antibacterial, flame resistant and repels odor and dirt. With roots in Japanese culture dating back to the 1600s, indigo-dyed fabrics were worn under the armor of samurais to help keep bacteria from wounds. Today, five farmers keep the tradition of growing indigo alive in Tokushima, Japan. \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Frontiers series, where we bring you front and center to the dreamers, pioneers, and innovators leading society at the cutting edge.

"New York bagels are a thing of legend, but how exactly does the city boil and bake its dough? At Murray's Bagels in Greenwich Village, the ingredients haven't strayed too far from the original, century-old recipe: All you need is flour, salt, yeast, barley malt, and, of course, NYC tap water. Owned by Adam Pomerantz, Murray's prides itself on churning out perfectly chewy bagels with an even, golden-brown crust. The result is something well-suited to a schmear of cream cheese, a slice of lox, or a slab of bacon and eggs.\n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",26

"HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM HTME!  WE HAVE A LOT PLANNED FOR 2018. But first, to wrap up our last episode in our Preservatives Series.\n\nHave you ever wondered what all those complicated ingredients are in your white bread?  Are they dangerous and what are they actually doing to the bread?  Is it true that some breads are made using drywall and human hair?\n\nAndy visits a Baker and a Food Scientist to learn the pros and cons of using additives in your bread.

"Making resolutions to be a better person is a hugely important activity - even if we can't always stick to every last one.

In the modern world, the idea of trying to be good or kind conjures up all sorts of negative associations: of piety, solemnity, bloodlessness and sexual renunciation. Itâ€™s telling that â€˜wickedâ€™ has even become a term of praise.\nAnd yet the project of being good is as vital, or even more important, for the individual and society as is the project of being healthy. Yet while we have no problem with going to the gym to get fitter, it sounds deeply weird, even creepy, to suggest that one might â€˜workâ€™ at being better or nicerâ€¦â€\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/17DqjX\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/b461ah\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/7m4wde\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nKhyan Mansley\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Khyan1\nhttps://twitter.com/khyan?lang=en",27
A LOT of you have been asking me to talk about this so I finally caved and did it. I absolutely loved working with Netflix and I can't express in words how grateful I am that they took a chance on me and gave me 2 season of my own Netflix Original Series. It was a total dream come true! The weird stuff that happened with Customer Service was a bizarre fluke that only happened for a few days and then Netflix worked really hard to resolve the issue. I have no beef or drama with Netflix. Only gratitude. Hope I cleared the air for you all! I can't wait for you all to see the projects I'm planning on in 2018! Love you so much!

We travel in India for street food, and went on a DEEP Street Food TOUR in Amritsar PUNJAB, to try some of the most AMAZING street food around the world! The Food Ranger (Trevor James) is in India eating Street Food! This truly was an amazing STREET FOOD ADVENTURE in INDIA with AMAZING curry, breakfast, and delicious restaurants with UNIQUE Indian food recipes and Indian dinner!\n\nIf you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Amritsar. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.\n\nIn one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didnâ€™t realize until after we finished eating, but we didnâ€™t eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!\n\nWe started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. Iâ€™m pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. Itâ€™s stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. Itâ€™s sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. Itâ€™s served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.\n\nThe next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!\n\nAfterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.\n\nAfter this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!\n\nAfter this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!\n\nAfter this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.\n\nThe addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:\n\n1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut\nGali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India\n2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets\nShop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar\n3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly canâ€™t remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).\n4) Delicious Street Lassi at Ahuja Lassi\nNear Hindu College, Amritsar, India\n5) BEST Vegetarian Curry in the WORLD @ Kesar De Dhaba, Amritsar\n6) Amazing Mango sour and spicy dessert at Aam Papad:\nRam lubhaya and sons\n7) Potato Samosa at Raam samosey wala\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious . I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

"In this video we explore some of the simple mathematics of amplitude modulation, see how sidebands arise, and illustrate these concepts using a digital oscilloscope in FFT mode. Interestingly, research into SSB began in the early 1900s, as described in http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/pdf/McElroy.pdf. There are numerous resources on the Net with additional information beyond what is presented here; see, e.g., http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/am-amplitude-modulation/theory-equations.php and the several tutorial pages at that URL.",28
"Taken from the album RÃ©publique Amazone\nStream/purchase the album: http://smarturl.it/AmazonesdAfrique\n\nLes Amazones dâ€™Afrique are an all-female collective of west African musicians, campaigning for gender equality. They have been described as a supergroup, and the characterisation seems apt. AngÃ©lique Kidjo, Kandia KouyatÃ©, Mamani Keita, Mariam Doumbia, Mariam KonÃ©, Massan Coulibaly, Mouneissa Tandina, Nneka, Pamela Badjogo and Rokia KonÃ© hold a strong pedigree, and itâ€™s a rare opportunity to witness such a collaboration; the real sound of contemporary Africa.\n\nThe album showcases the sparkling range and versatility of its songstresses. Running on funk and blues with dabs of dub; ancient rhythms blending seamlessly with their western appropriated cousins, Les Amazones d'Afrique sound like an aural actuation of the new melting pot cities of the African continent.",10

"You can support this channel on Patreon!  Link below\nThroughout much of the analog television era, Sony was the fairly undisputed king of TVs.  Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Ã–rn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

Rothschild, is still around today and is believed to be worth over a trillion dollars combined, thought to be the largest private fortunate in the history of the world.

"In Theaters February 2, 2018\n#WinchesterMovie\n\nInspired by true events.  On an isolated stretch of land 50 miles outside of San Francisco sits the most haunted house in the world.  Built by Sarah Winchester, (Academy AwardÂ®-winner Helen Mirren) heiress to the Winchester fortune, it is a house that knows no end.  Constructed in an incessant twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week mania for decades, it stands seven stories tall and contains hundreds of rooms.  To the outsider it looks like a monstrous monument to a disturbed womanâ€™s madness. But Sarah is not building for herself, for her niece (Sarah Snook) or for the troubled Doctor Eric Price (Jason Clarke) whom she has summoned to the house.  She is building a prison, an asylum for hundreds of vengeful ghosts, and the most terrifying among them have a score to settle with the Winchestersâ€¦",24

Or choose your own path and download the free app for iOS and Android.\n\nGet More Mosaic:\nLike on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/watchmosaic\nOfficial Site: http://www.watchmosaic.com\n\nPresented by PodOp and developed for HBO by Soderbergh and Casey Silver, in conjunction with writer Ed Solomon, the MOSAIC app is an interactive storytelling experience, available as a free download in November, that will be followed by a six-part limited series that will air on HBO in January 2018.  Sharon Stone stars, along with Garrett Hedlund, Frederick Weller, Beau Bridges, Paul Reubens, Jennifer Ferrin, Devin Ratray, Michael Cerveris, James Ransone, Jeremy Bobb and Maya Kazan.\n\nThree years in the making, the MOSAIC app allows viewers to choose what point-of-view from which to follow the story and to, in effect, build their own experience from the material Soderbergh and Solomon created. The choices one makes build upon one another, enabling multiple tellings of the story from different perspectives and, sometimes, with different conclusions. Viewers will be able to see how their own versions of the story on the app ultimately compare to Soderberghâ€™s six-part linear narrative in January.\n\nSubscribe to the HBO YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/JQUfqt\n \nDonâ€™t have HBO?

No release date has been targeted at this time.\n\nBUY/SELL/AGREE/DISAGREE\n\nScreen Gems has released the first trailer for Slender Man, a horror adaptation of the famous Slender Man legend created from the Creepy Pasta forum.

Co-written and directed by Kick-Ass 2 helmer Jeff Wadlow, the supernatural thriller revolves around a continuing game of â€œTruth or Dareâ€ in which, if you donâ€™t tell the truth or refuse a dare, you die. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Rocha: https://twitter.com/TheRochaSays\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Reilly: https://twitter.com/ReillyAround\nFollow Ken: https://twitter.com/KenNapzok\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

De Steiguer has spent the past 19 winters tending to the 43-acre grounds of the hotel, on Star Island, which sits 10 miles off the coast of New England. In the long, wintry off-season, she is the islandâ€™s sole inhabitant.\n\nFor more information on the film, visit The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/549518/winters-watch/",1

"We partnered with one shape maker and a multimedia studio to create stop-motion magic. It took: \n25,000 magnets\n325 hours\n127 coffees\n2,500 photos\n780 frames\n\nAll of this amounted to 52 seconds. And it was totally worth it.\n\nWe wanted to make a video to pay homage to the good ol' days, so instead of heading to our computers to cook up some video graphics,, we went the stop-motion route. Speks is all about going off-screen and diving into shapeable, moldable, tactile fun. We like to think that our balls have endless possibilities with zero expectations. Our video shows just that. \n\nMoral of the story; If you want to create a mesmerizing stop-motion video with Speks, you can. If you want to mash them around and just go to town on them, you can do that too. We support you either way.\n\nSee more at www.getspeks.com.",28

"How the price of eggs sparked an uprising in Iran.\n\nRead more about the protests on Vox.com here: http://bit.ly/2m2r4k0.\n\nSince December 28th, Iran has undergone multiple days of populist protests. At least 20 deaths have occurred, as protestors clash with Iranian security forces, and hundreds of people have been arrested. The demonstrations began in Mashad, Iran's second largest cit, and have since spread throughout the country. There are multiple reasons for the protests, but the main one seems to stem from Iran's halting economy.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Of course, the shiny, 12-inch optical disc that once competed with VHS and Betamax in the home video market spun into oblivion long before. However, it was that Wednesday in January seven years ago that Pioneer â€“ the last remaining company to make the devices â€“ declared they were ceasing production after making a final run of 3,000 LaserDisc players, bringing the total made to just under 17 million units. â€œUnder the market environment in which new media such as DVD and Blu-ray Discs now dominate, it has become difficult for Pioneer to procure the parts required to produce LD players,â€ read Pioneerâ€™s press release. â€œConsequently Pioneer has been forced to terminate production of its LD products.â€\n\nWant the text version?: http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/08/why-laserdisc-lost/\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/10/27/5035596/lost-return-of-the-jedi-footage-discovered-on-699-laserdisc\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/49111/mr-wizard-explains-laserdisc\nhttp://www.cedmagic.com/history/discovision-marketed.html\nhttp://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/optical-laser-disc-player-is-demonstrated/\nhttp://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/innovationnation/2015/01/02/ces-gadget-hits-and-flops/2.html\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=OaEmmEOZ1fwC&pg=PA130-IA3&lpg=PA130-IA3&dq=why+laserdisc+failed&source=bl&ots=ICyBvWX99v&sig=5M2kv8tUM-tkydeGVO-i0Ioy18Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvx7TUgOrOAhVKRSYKHTIkBc04ChDoAQgyMAM#v=onepage&q=%20laserdisc&f=false\nhttp://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/laserdisc-officially-dead-14333\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/remember-when-video-discs-were-the-size-of-lps\nhttps://www.google.com/patents/US3350503?dq=3350503&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj12YmEjOrOAhVJfiYKHScoBMcQ6AEIHDAA\nhttp://www.blamld.com/DiscoVision/LaserMagic1998.htm\nhttp://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/magnetic4.html\nhttp://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/john-t-mullin-man-who-put-bing-crosby-tape/373927\nhttp://inventors.about.com/od/ofamousinventions/a/Optical_Disk.htm\nhttp://www.wired.com/2011/06/0607betamax-vcr-television-recorder\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5316154/magnavox-magnavision-model-8000-discovision-laserdisc-player-reviewed\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LDDVDComparison-mod.png\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Paul_Gregg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_(inventor)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_bias\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiscoVision\n\nImage Credit:\n\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-130064534/stock-photo-compact-discs-full-of-music-laser-compact-disc-sound-technology\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-176455267/stock-photo-personal-cd-player-with-remote-control-and-portable-audio-earphones-on-black-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-140485571/stock-photo-remote-control-and-blu-ray-or-dvd-player-with-inserted-disc\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-126567410/stock-photo-video-tapes-audio-tapes-and-compact-disc-on-a-wooden-table\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-161982692/stock-photo-finger-pressing-a-microphone-button-to-activate-an-on-air-sign-composite-between-an-image-and-a-3d-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-164913281/stock-photo-3d-illustration-of-at-home-shaped-target-over-black-background-and-one-arrow-in-the-center-with-a-sign-where-it-is-written-the-word-sold-concept-of-real-estate\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-213935233/stock-photo-3d-illustration-of-rubber-stamp-with-the-text-patented-ip-law-and-intellectual-property-patent-concept\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-181439842/stock-photo-hand-writing-expensive-with-marker\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-126561608/stock-photo-closeup-of-a-stack-compact-discs-%28cd-dvd%29\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-138250820/stock-photo-map-with-pin-point-of-atlanta-in-georgia%2C-usa\n\nMusic from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com.",27

My soft-flowing hair should be the Eighth Wonder of the World. It's that glorious. Men covet it. Women fawn over it.\n\nSo that's how confident I felt about dismissing the New Orleans Saints after the team's 0-2 start in 2017. I put my hair on the line during an episode of Dunc & Holder on Sports 1280 AM and NOLA.com after the Saints fell in Week 2. The video proof is below:\n\n\nThe Saints proceeded to win eight consecutive games after my grand proclamation. They finished the regular season 11-5 and as the NFC South champions.\n\nI'll take all the credit for being the team's motivating factor. I'll also have to pay the price and shave my head.\n\nI'll have my hair completely shredded at Tracey's Original Irish Bar (2604 Magazine Street) 4 p.m.-6 p.m. Thursday afternoon.\n\nColumnist Jeff Duncan will certainly have the first chop at my hair for being the person to claim a 10-win season for the Saints. Many others will fight for the chance to finish the job.,17

"SRL performed at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SF Museum of Modern Art, effectively shutting down the SF downtown area for about 15 min! Edited and Directed By Leslie Asako Gladsjo. \n\nThe Museum was so pleased with the SRL show that they actually  attempted to sue us a few months later. Recently, when speaking to a museum employee conducting research into the 1992 Groundbreaking for inclusion into the new ribbon cutting at the rebuilt SFMOMA, SRL was informed that the Museum had systematically removed all reference to SRL even being at the 1992 Groundbreaking!  The only remaining historical document is this SRL produced video.\n\nIt takes serious skills to stage a show at a major museum that would provoke them into completely rewriting the show out of their own history. SRL says: Mission Accomplished!! Also, its still not too late to invite us for the Ribbon Cutting.....",28

"Rebellious, quick-witted Erica Vandross (Zoey Deutch) is a 17-year-old firecracker living with her single mom Laurie (Kathryn Hahn) and mom's new boyfriend Bob (Tim Heidecker) in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. When Bob's mentally unbalanced son Luke (Joey Morgan) arrives from rehab to live with the family, Erica finds her domestic and personal life overwhelmed.

"A rich family. A wealth of problems. Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for Trust, FXâ€™s new series from Academy Award winners Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Premieres March 25th.\n\nSubscribe now for more Trust clips: http://bit.ly/SubscribeFX \n\nTrust delves into the trials and triumphs of one of Americaâ€™s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldnâ€™t pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaulâ€™s grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. Heâ€™s busy. Paulâ€™s father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paulâ€™s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, sheâ€™s broke. Trust charts the teenage grandsonâ€™s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle. The show is produced by FX Productions, Cloud Eight Films, Decibel Films and Snicket Films Limited.\n\nTrust | Season 1: Official Trailer [HD] | FX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/FXNetworks",24

"Documentaire in seven parts:Tim Rollins and his collaborators, high school students from the South Bronx, NY, typically make works based on classic literature. He discovered that his students responded to art - art taught his way, not the way it is usually taught in public schools. Some of Rollins' students became a group of regulars who participated in an after-school and weekend program called the Art of Knowledge Workshop. The students named themselves K.O.S. which stands for Kids of Survival. What we're doing changes people's conception about who can make art, how art is made, who can learn and what's possible, because a lot of these kids had been written off by the school system.

"Date: January 2, 2018\nLocation: Nantucket, MA\nTemperature: 12.0 Â°F\nOcean: 36Â°F\n\nWith a floundering temperature in the low, single digits this past week, I knew there was a good chance the Slurpee Waves would find their way back to Nantucket, photographer Jonathan Nimerfroh told us. Sure enough, on the morning of January 2nd I pulled my car up to Nobadeer beach and there they were. This time, two friends surfed just beyond the icy eddie, hooting and hollering and holding up giant icebergs above their heads in neoprene gloved hands. I ran up and down the beach, taking as many shots as I could of this freezing, fleeting show of nature. Slurpee waves are the kind of thing you might only be lucky enough to see once, so I count myself as very lucky to have seen them twice.\n\nFilm & Photos:\nJonathan Nimerfroh\n@jdnphotography\nwww.jdnphotography.com\n\nEdit: KeDa Creative Group\n@kedacreative\nwww.kedacreative.com\n\nMusic: Electronic Pasture by Floyd Kellogg @floydkellogg\nwww.floydkellogg.com\n\nSurfers:\nJamie Briard @soil_surfer\n\nNick Hayden @nickhaydenpercussion\n\nThe Inertia: The Definitive Voice of Surf, Mountain, and Outdoors // http://www.theinertia.com \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/TheInertiaYT\n\nFollow us!\nhttps://twitter.com/the_inertia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheInertia\nhttp://instagram.com/theinertia\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/theinertia/",17

A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.,15

"Prepare for cuteness overload! ðŸ¼ On April 6, take a journey with PANDAS. #IMAXPandas\n\nPandas are beloved around the world, and now they are coming to the big screen in the IMAXÂ® original film â€œPandas,â€ a breathtaking documentary adventure and amazing experience for the whole family.\n\nAt Chengdu Panda Base in China, scientists are dedicated to protecting the species by breeding adult Giant Pandas in order to introduce cubs into the wild.  This film follows one such researcher, whose passion leads her to initiate a new technique inspired by a black bear program in rural New Hampshire.  What starts as a cross-culture collaboration becomes a life-changing journey for an American biologist who crosses an ocean to join her; a scientist from Inner Mongolia; and a very curious female cub named Qian Qian, born in captivity. \n\nCaptured with IMAXÂ® Cameras, join Qian Qian on an exciting new adventure in the mountains of Sichuan as she takes her first steps outside her protected habitat, discovering her true animal natureâ€¦even as she faces the challenges of the unknown. \n\nDavid Douglas and Drew Fellman, the filmmakers behind â€œBorn to be Wildâ€ and â€œIsland of Lemurs: Madagascar,â€ directed the film, which Fellman wrote and produced, with Douglas as director of photography.  Donald Kushner and Steve Ransohoff also produced the film, with Li Gen Xiong and Elie Samaha executive producing and Neal Allen serving as line producer. \n\nâ€œBorn to be Wildâ€ and â€œIsland of Lemurs: Madagascarâ€ editor Beth Spiegel and composer Mark Mothersbaugh collaborated with Douglas and Fellman once again, with sound design by Gus Koven. \n\nIMAX Entertainment presents, in association with IMAX Documentary Films Capital and Panda Productions, â€œPandas.â€   The film will be released in select IMAXÂ® and IMAXÂ® 3D theaters starting April 6, 2018.  The film is rated G.",24

"Timelapse video of a complete log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what Iâ€™m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook â€“ https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) â€“ https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram â€“ https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",24

But then those haunting vocals hit my ears...and blew my mind. It was like a punch deep in my soul. It's hard to explain that feeling when you first hear a song and you immediately fall in love with it. Almost like you've known it all along.\n\nI hadn't even planned to start working on this film yet, but I was so inspired that I furiously began to lay down time-lapse clips. I couldn't stop pouring over it. It was last September and I was supposed to be working on Monsoon IV, but I forgot all about it once I heard Ex Makina's Breathe.Â It almost felt like it was made for a black and white storm film.\n\nAbout halfway through editing, I knew the song title would be my film title as well. It was so perfect I couldn't believe it. Sometimes for me...when I'm chasing or watching an amazing storm...I'll realize I haven't taken a breath in awhile. Never really thought of it until I heard this song.\n\nI love being inspired by other artists. I love soundtracks. I can't imagine the movie Interstellar without that powerful pipe organ soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.Â Music is so important to what I do and I'm so incredibly thankful to husband/wife duoÂ Iain and Rebecca CampbellÂ for writing this amazing song. Thanks to the MusicBed as well for having such fantastic musicians and artists.\n\nIn early 2017, I put together a film called Pulse that was my first ever black and white time-lapse movie. It was so different and fun, I wanted to do a follow-up this year before the next chase season begins.Â Breathe is made up solely of storm clips from 2017...either from the spring across the central plains or from the monsoon here in the southwest. Some are favorites, some are just ones I knew would be amazing in monochrome and others I used because they fit the music so well.Â  I also went with a wider aspect ratio on these films to give it more of a cinematic feel.\n\nThis is also the first film I've ever done in full 8K resolution. I'm super excited about that. You may not be able to watch it in that resolution, but it's there if you can. Otherwise, 4K is a must if you can!\n\nI truly hope you enjoy this. For me, I needed something to pass the time and bridge the next few months as I wait for supercells to return to the plains. But honestly, I truly love putting these together. Thanks for all your support in the past and feel free to share!\n\nTechnical Details:\n\nI used two Canon 5DSR's along with a Canon 11-24mm, 35mm, 50mm, 135mm and Sigma Art 50mm. Manfrotto tripods.

"PresentaciÃ³n en directo de Yerry MIna como nuevo jugador del FC Barcelona, desde el Camp Nou.\nLa de este sÃ¡bado en el Camp Nou ha sido una presentaciÃ³n atÃ­pica. No es habitual que un nuevo jugador del FC Barcelona conecte tan pronto con la aficiÃ³n como lo ha hecho Yerry Mina. El defensa ha reunido a un total de 8.552 espectadores en el Camp Nou, muchos de ellos aficionados colombianos que ya conocÃ­an al futbolista desde sus inicios en Deportivo Pasto e Independiente Santa Fe. En las gradas ha habido mÃºsica, bailes y mucha fiesta.\n\nLa presentaciÃ³n ha tenido de todo. Ha arrancado con Yerry Mina descalzÃ¡ndose los zapatos y las medias en un ritual habitual en Ã©l antes de pisar el cÃ©sped y llevar a cabo los habituales toques de balÃ³n. Era la primera vez que el central lucÃ­a la que serÃ¡ su nueva equipaciÃ³n a partir de ahora, y ha dejado clara su felicidad con un grito apasionado: Â¡Vamos, BarÃ§a! Visca, BarÃ§a!.\n\nA continuaciÃ³n, el jugador ha posado para los medios de comunicaciÃ³n -se han acreditado 103 periodistas, 25 de ellos colombianos, de un total de 70 medios diferentes- y ha completado un rondo con jÃ³venes jugadores de la cantera. DespuÃ©s el futbolista ha recibido su coche AUDI.\n\nCon cualquier otro jugador la presentaciÃ³n habrÃ­a acabado segundos mÃ¡s tarde. Pero Yerry Mina se ha acercado hasta el gol para saludar a toda la aficiÃ³n que lo ha venido a recibir. Y allÃ­ ha dejado una pequeÃ±a pincelada de uno de sus rasgos mÃ¡s caracterÃ­sticos: el baile de salsa 'choke' que suele llevar a cabo cada vez que marca un gol. Seguro que volveremos a ver este movimiento en un futuro.",24

While exactly why humans do this hasnâ€™t yet been definitively proven (with the most popular theory being that, while not essential, itâ€™s mostly about improving balance and decreasing angular momentum of the body), the fact remains that this is how the vast majority of humans all over the world walkâ€¦ But not so with Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation.\n\nWant the text version?: http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2017/09/vladimir-putin-walk-weird/\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/KGBAlphaTeamTrainingManualHowTheSovietsTrainedForPersonalCombatAssassinationAndS\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_swing_in_human_locomotion\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev\nhttp://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6141\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/16/putin-gunslinger-gait-kgb-training-report\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\n\nImage Credit:\n\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-172353899/stock-photo-young-businessman-wearing-glasses-and-suitcase-is-walking%2C-side-picture-in-studio\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-126862307/stock-photo-why-word-from-wood-black-and-white-of-wooden-why-question-mark-on-black-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-175406296/stock-photo-vertical-image-of-hipster-which-walking-with-laptop-in-studio-full-length-portrait-over-gray-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-55320623/stock-photo-neurology-questions\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-198964102/stock-photo-high-angle-view-of-senior-doctors-and-young-surgeons-discussing-over-patient-case-doctors-and-nurses-talking-to-each-other-about-medical-results-with-copy-space\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-177684106/stock-photo-book-with-title-privacy-law-on-a-wooden-surface\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Putin_12020.jpg\nhttp://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/medium/k1rAW5z472lwkmookANxuaG4VUphwjUN.jpg\nhttp://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/presidentphotos/big/wTn73tTeJG6VO4bQ1zCe0oPlAZK0uy12.jpg\nhttp://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/GDttx9UEDTANQfVpxWAS2qFw3eufPmBj.jpg\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/wapster/8296900458\nhttp://archive.government.ru/media/2012/5/9/50011/photolenta_1024.jpeg\nhttp://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/GtyylyB80LYuLMqWh8vUd2AjLMu5rhtW.jpeg\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anatoly_Sidorov,_2014.jpg\nhttp://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/N7uc4yDsriYQ2JGipFZ9mrBrPtmWASzt.jpeg\nhttp://archive.government.ru/media/2008/11/20/10458/photolenta_big_photo.jpeg\n\nMusic from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com.",27

It passed without a single vote from Democrats in the House or the Senate, and itâ€™s a huge windfall for the richest Americans, including President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Republicans didnâ€™t just want any new tax law, they wanted to reform the tax code. To give the richest Americans a big tax cut while still funding the governmentâ€™s essential functions, like building roads and flying fighter jets, the GOP needed to find tax revenue somewhere else. To do that, they had to start taxing income that used to be tax-free, by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions. \n\nIf all of that sounds boring and confusing, fear not.

Reginae Carter is starring in the second season of â€œGrowing Up Hip Hop: Atlantaâ€ and her take on the Khia/Queens Court beef may shock you.,24
A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video near the town of Woolgoolga in NSW.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.,15

She was 46.\n\nIrish and international singer Dolores O'Riordan has died suddenly in London today. She was 46 years old.

"The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado has made its official debut, dropping 450 lbs over the outgoing model and adding a diesel engine option.\n\nAvailable engines for the all-new Silverado include heavily updated versions of the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter Small Block, along with an all-new 3.0-liter inline-six Duramax diesel engine. General Motors didnâ€™t share details on the dieselâ€™s power output, but head of GM product development, Mark Reuss, assured us it would be more powerful than Fordâ€™s new diesel in the F-150. The diesel and the 6.2 will be available with GMâ€™s new Hydramatic 10-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3 will come with the eight-speed.\n\nThe significant 450 lbs in weight savings come thanks to the use of aluminum in the hood, doors and rear liftgate. The vehicleâ€™s â€˜safety cageâ€™ also uses seven different grades of steel to offer a good mix of lightness and strength. Furthermore, the front upper control arms are made of aluminum, while the rear springs are made of a new carbon-composite material, which shaves more pounds from the pickup.\n\nSubscribe\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AutoGuideVideo\n\nYouTube - http://www.youtube.com/user/AutoguideVideo\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/AutoGuide\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/AutoGuide\nGoogle+ - http://goo.gl/LBxsP\nWeb - http://www.AutoGuide.com\n\nAutoGuide reviews the latest new cars with test drives, car comparisons and shootouts plus coverage of breaking auto industry news, auto shows, rumors and spy photos.

"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRydÂ \n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nHOMEMADE PASTA\nServings: 6 \nINGREDIENTS\n1 Â½ cups flour\n3 eggs, beaten\nÂ¼ cup salt\nPREPARATION\nCreate a small mountain of flour and, using a spoon, begin building a hole in the middle. It should end up looking like a small volcano. \nGradually add eggs in the volcanoâ€™s hole, and carefully incorporate eggs and flour.\nOnce all ingredients have been mixed, knead the dough by pulling, stretching, and folding for about 3-5 minutes, or until it turns elastic and semi-easy to mold. \nMold the dough into a sphere, and wrap it in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes, or until the dough becomes more relaxed, elastic, and much easier to mold. \nCut the dough in four pieces. Grab the first one, and keep the other wrapped, or cover them with a slightly wet towel to keep them fresh. \nFlatten the first piece, and run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker. Increase the thinness number by one level each time you run the pasta through the machine. \nOnce you can see your fingers through the dough, proceed to cut the fettuccine, or any shape you wish. \nIn a pot with boiling water and salt, cook the pasta for 2 minutes or until it feels tender to the bite. \nServe with your favorite pasta sauce and enjoy!\nRecipe inspired by: http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/homemade-pasta-dough-420521\nAlso inspired by: http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/40520\n\n\nMUSIC\nTEu\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nDaisychain_Instrumental\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nPrice Is Wrong_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nHolding Your Nerve_Full\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nLong Way To Go_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nTour de Force_Full Mix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nWinner_Instrumental (1)\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nGet The Funny Thief_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_inst\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nOrangenbaum_Fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nFifth Avenue_Undrscr\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nSTILLS\nSmall British kitten and bottle of milk\nOkssi68/Getty Images\nBrit Awards 2013 - Red Carpet Arrivals\nEamonn McCormack/Getty Images",26

"Martin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence\nStarting in 1965, King began to express doubts about the United States' role in the Vietnam War. In an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church â€” exactly one year before his death â€” King delivered Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence. In the speech he spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, insisting that the U.S. was in Vietnam to occupy it as an American colony and calling the U.S. government the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.\nNow, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.\nAt this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 -- April 4, 1968), was one of the main leaders of the American civil rights movement. A Baptist minister by training, King became a civil rights activist early in his career, leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his I Have a Dream speech, raising public consciousness of the civil rights movement and establishing King as one of the greatest orators in American history. In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means.\n\nDr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Martin Luther King Day was established as a national holiday in the United States in 1986. In 2004, King was posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence - Vietnam MLK Iraq\nMartin Luther King - A Time to Break Silence MLK Vietnam Iraq",25

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent.  Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her fatherâ€™s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that heâ€™s truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara canâ€™t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.\n\nLeaving everything she knows behind, Lara goes in search of her dadâ€™s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldnâ€™t be higher for Lara, whoâ€”against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spiritâ€”must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.  If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, â€œTomb Raiderâ€ is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (â€œEx Machina,â€ â€œThe Danish Girlâ€) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (â€œThe Waveâ€), with Oscar-winner Graham King (â€œThe Departedâ€) producing under his GK Films banner.  The executive producers are Patrick McCormick, Denis Oâ€™Sullivan and Noah Hughes.\nâ€œTomb Raiderâ€ also stars Dominic West (â€œMoney Monster,â€ â€œ300â€), Walton Goggins (â€œThe Hateful Eight,â€ â€œDjango Unchainedâ€), Daniel Wu (AMCâ€™s â€œInto the Badlandsâ€) and Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas (â€œThe English Patientâ€).\nUthaug directed from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.  The directorâ€™s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (â€œMission: Impossible â€“ Rogue Nationâ€); production designer Gary Freeman (â€œMaleficentâ€); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (â€œSkyfall,â€ â€œGorillas in the Mistâ€) and editor Michael Tronick (â€œSuicide Squadâ€); Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Themâ€) and costume designer Timothy A. Wonsik (assistant costume designer, â€œFree State of Jones,â€ â€œIron Man 3â€).  The music is by Tom Holkenborg (â€œMad Max: Fury Roadâ€).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures present, a Square Enix production, a GK Films production, â€œTomb Raider.â€ \n\nSet for release beginning March 16, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by MGM.",1

The main theme of â€˜Heroineâ€™ is â€˜a flower locked in iceâ€™, describing the earlier story of â€˜Gashinaâ€™ in which the woman had to accept the sad breakup by saying â€˜Why do you leave behind pretty me?â€™ to herself. This track delicately describes the womanâ€™s frozen heart with SUNMIâ€™s sensibility, who gets hurt by the lopsided relationship with the person she loves but tries to understand the person.   \nÂ \n#SUNMI#ì„ ë¯¸#Heroine#ì£¼ì¸ê³µ#Newrelease#MV#1theK#ì›ë”ì¼€ì´\n\nâ–¶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\nâ–¶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\nâ–¶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc",10

"Earth's surface temperatures in 2017 were the second warmest since since 1880, when global estimates first become feasible, NASA scientists found. \nGlobal temperatures 2017 were second only to 2016, which still holds the record for the hottest year; however, 2017 was the warmest year on record that did not start with an El Nino weather pattern, as the previous two years did. \nIn a separate, independent analysis, NOAA scientists found that 2017 was the third-warmest year in their record. The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday, January 17th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Jay Washington, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Flashâ€™ Standalone Film Taps Directors John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n2) First Official Synopsis for â€˜Solo: A Star Wars Storyâ€™ Teases an Eventful Adventure\n\n3) First Trailer for Gus Van Santâ€™s: â€˜Donâ€™t Worry, He Wonâ€™t Get Far on Footâ€™ starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Black and Jonah Hill\n\n4) New â€˜Ant-Man and the Waspâ€™ Image Shows Off the Title Team, All Suited Up\n\n5) New trailer released for Love, Simon\n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety is reporting that the Vacation helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are in negotiations to direct Flashpoint, the Flashâ€™s standalone feature starring Ezra Miller. Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the directorâ€™s chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie thatâ€™s coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disneyâ€™s 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Donâ€™t Worry, He Wonâ€™t Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvelâ€™s upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael PeÃ±a and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hopeâ€™s mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalliâ€™s novel, Greg Berlantiâ€™s film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that heâ€™s gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate heâ€™s fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",24

"The bicycle industry is almost entirely comprised of enthusiasts and dreamers, but the crew at the San Luis Obispo development facility takes it to a level of intensity that is simply a notch higher. The SLO team operates as a true competitive familyâ€”the kind in which you refuse to be one-upped by your sibling, but where you become the worldâ€™s loudest cheerleader when your sibling wins. \n\nThis competitive family dynamic is abundantly evident in the SLO groupâ€™s newest creation, DUB. This is a product that you donâ€™t see or hear. Itâ€™s a product whose measure of success is when youâ€™re not thinking about it. And yet the development teamâ€™s excitement for this new product is motivating, even contagious.\n\nTasked with creating a lighter crankset, the engineers here could have easily phoned it inâ€”checked the spreadsheet boxes, so to speak. But this is a group of individuals that attacks Movember as if it were the Mountain Bike World Championships, so â€˜just checking the boxâ€™ doesnâ€™t really fall into the vernacular. They didnâ€™t want any checked-box product on their bikes, so they made something better. \n\nDUB, as they called it, is a simple solution to an often-tedious problem. DUB is a bottom bracket spindle and bearing design that allows lighter cranksets. DUB allows better bearing seals for better performance over the long term. DUB allows SRAMâ€™s test engineers to perform more focused sets of tests. DUB is forward and backward compatible. DUB makes your life, as a bottom bracket user, easier. \n\nDUB is one more simple solution dreamed up, designed, developed, tested, ridden and loved by a dedicated group of people in San Luis Obispo who live to make better parts for the bicycles they ride.",17

The main theme of â€˜Heroineâ€™ is â€˜a flower locked in iceâ€™, describing the earlier story of â€˜Gashinaâ€™ in which the woman had to accept the sad breakup by saying â€˜Why do you leave behind pretty me?â€™ to herself. This track delicately describes the womanâ€™s frozen heart with SUNMIâ€™s sensibility, who gets hurt by the lopsided relationship with the person she loves but tries to understand the person.   \nÂ \n#SUNMI#ì„ ë¯¸#Heroine#ì£¼ì¸ê³µ#Newrelease#MV#1theK#ì›ë”ì¼€ì´\n\nâ–¶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\nâ–¶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\nâ–¶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc",10

"Michael Mosley, author of the 5:2 diet and the Clever Guts Diet, spoke to Business Insider UK and explained why a healthy diet is much more important than exercise when it comes to losing weight. \n\nMosley said, An awful lot of people go to the gym in January in order to lose weight. They think if they go to the gym and cycle a bit and do a bit of running then they will obviously shed some of those kilos. The reality is that that does not happen which is why the vast majority of people give up.\n\nIn order to lose a kilo of fat you would probably have to run two marathons. So in many ways it is obviously much easier simply to reduce the amount of calories you eat rather than trying to run them off because you have to do so much exercise to burn calories.\n\nWhat I would recommend is yes, you do exercise because thatâ€™s going to improve your mood and itâ€™s very helpful once youâ€™ve lost weight but hoping that simply by doing exercise youâ€™re going to lose weight is really over optimistic.\n\nYou should be aware of these tendencies but as I said if you really want to lose weight the only way to do that is by reducing the calories you eat and switching the sort of food you eat.\n\n----------------------------------------Â­Â­Â­Â­----------\n\nFollow BI UK on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1Nz3jG3\nFollow BI UK on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1VWDkiy\nFollow BI UK on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2gsLEds\nRead more on BI UK: uk.businessinsider.com\n\n----------------------------------------Â­Â­Â­Â­----------\n\nBusiness Insider UK is the largest business news site for British readers and viewers in the UK.

"I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as â€œjockeysâ€ as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. Itâ€™s basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one Iâ€™ve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.",22

Some say MC more accurately follow the groove, but I doubt Iâ€™d notice the difference. \n\nQ) How does it play 10 records?\nA) Come on man - how many 10 records do you have really - I had one and the Rokblok ruined it - however if I had hundreds like you do then it's not a problem - remember the manual operation section in the video where I drop the stylus where I want on a disc - yep, you do that. \n\n-------------SUPPORT---------------\nThis channel can be supported through Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/techmoan\nPatrons usually have early access to videos\n\n---------------SUBSCRIBE------------------\n http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1\n\n----------Outro Music-----------\nOver Time - Vibe Tracks https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw\n\n------Outro Sound Effect------\nThatSFXGuy - https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM\n\nLINKS: Amazon/eBay links are affiliated where possible.",28

It can be a stressful journey that involves cars, trains, bicycles, and even airplanes. This video breaks down the pros and cons of long commutes -- it's by someone who actually has a painfully long one: Vox's Kimberly Mas commutes to Manhattan almost every day. She drives her car to the train station, takes the train to the subway, and finally rides the subway to the Vox office. She's had this routine for a long time and she always wondered what kind of toll it's taking on her. Her reporting shows that, while commutes may just be an unavoidable part of life for many Americans, they don't have to be all bad, all the time.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"More Celebrity News â–ºâ–º http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorganâ€™s good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you canâ€™t help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryanâ€™s face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven â€” and these actresses and so many more have proven â€” we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey",24

It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car everyday.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\nThe Perfect Gooseys wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook â–º http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter â–º http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram â–º http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat â–º http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter â–º http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nðŸŽ¬ Got a film?

"Pacific Rim Uprising â€“ In Theaters, RealD 3D and IMAX March 23\nOfficial Trailer 2 - http://www.pacificrimmovie.com \n\nThe globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising. \n\nJohn Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanityâ€™s victory against the monstrous â€œKaiju.â€ Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his fatherâ€™s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)â€”who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furiousâ€™ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left.

Learn more at http://omele.to/2n1IT2q.\n\nGeorge attends the competitive private school Auburn Academy, where he struggles to keep up with the other students.\n\nAuburn is a harsh, even cruel, place, full of overachievers who are often mean to the boy -- if they aren't completely ignoring him. It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car everyday.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\nThe Perfect Gooseys wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook â–º http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter â–º http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram â–º http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat â–º http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter â–º http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nðŸŽ¬ Got a film?

"This is a test fire in advance of SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy test launch. The test occurred on 1/24/2018 at Kennedy Space Center's LC-39 Pad A which is the same pad that many Apollo and Space Shuttle launches took place from. SpaceX is currently leasing the pad from NASA. Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy.",28

"SUBSCRIBE to Barcroft Animals: http://bit.ly/2ceCJY0\n\nA DARING mother and son duo have hand-raised 14 bears in their back garden. In the heart of Bearadise Ranch, Florida, Monica Welde and her son, Johnny IV, spend their days rolling around with bears that weigh up to 1,000lbs. The Welde family have looked after grizzly bears, black bears and polar bears for the last 91 years â€“ using their license to provide for those in need of a home. But the family tradition came under threat last year when Monicaâ€™s husband, Johnny III, died of a heart attack just after he turned 60. But with the help of her son, a devastated Monica has put her loss to one side so she can concentrate on continuing the family legacy and caring for their beloved pet bears.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rodrigo Gomez\nProducer: Danny Baggot, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal \n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/\nFollow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimals\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videos\n\nDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",15

"Occurred on January 16, 2018 / Norway\n\n I came home from work happy to see that the stairs inside was finally finished. After a short while, we started to look for our cat. After we moved he doesn't like being outside, so I was sure he was indoor. I called his name 'Sverre' many times and after a while heard a weak meow. My kids Julie, 4 and Mikkel, 7 years old was at home as well, and when we realized the sound came from inside the stairs they started crying right away. I tried to calm them, but they were very scared. It was very difficult to open the planks, as it was very solid built steps! My husband was on the mountain, so I called a friend and neighbor and asked if he could come help us. Shortly after he arrived with a drill to open the wall of the stairs. After 45 min or so, we finally got him out. he was very stressed and tried to help us make the whole bigger. Very happy it ended well! He was in there for 5 hours, so I could have ended very differently. So glad he replied when I called his name! He must have gone to check out the area under the stairs when the carpenter was outside to cut the planks for the stairs. Sverre, the cat,  was very cozy after getting out!\n\nWatch ViralHog videos every day!\n\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/A0gBKk\nLike us on Facebook: https://goo.gl/XQWqJt\nFollow us on Instagram: https://goo.gl/NMq8dl\nFollow us on Twitter: https://goo.gl/pF8Xop\n\nSubmit your own great video and make money: https://goo.gl/yejGkm\n\nContact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video.",15

After the last rather badly edited robot-arm-music-video I decided to throw together some of the footage to make a more informative kind of video. In this video I show what this little Arduino/Raspberry Pi powered stepper robot arm with record and play functionality is capable to do.\n\nHere's a blog post about this project:\nhttps://electrondust.com/2018/01/21/small-stepper-robot-arm/\n\nA really quick summary on how it works:\n- The Gripper uses a servo which is controlled by the Raspberry Pi.\n- This robot arm uses 4 cheap geared stepping motors. \n- The motors are powered by 4 A4988 drivers. \n- The drivers are controlled by an Arduino Mega running a modified version of grbl:\nhttps://github.com/dguerizec/grbl-Mega-4axis\n- The Arduino waits for movement commands coming in via serial port.\n- The movement comments are being sent from a Raspberry Pi.\n- The replica arm which is used to control the pose of the arm is mode of 4 potentiometers.\n- The potentiometers are connected to a MCP3006 (this is a A/D converter chip). The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm,28

"Opening in theaters and VOD February 23rd\n\nDirected by: David Freyne\nStarring: Ellen Page, Sam Keeley, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor & Paula Malcomson\n\nWhat happens when the undead return to life? In a world ravaged for years by a virus that turns the infected into zombie-like cannibals, a cure is at last found and the wrenching process of reintegrating the survivors back into society begins. Among the formerly afflicted is Senan (Sam Keeley), a young man haunted by the horrific acts he committed while infected. Welcomed back into the family of his widowed sister-in-law (Ellen Page), Senan attempts to restart his lifeâ€”but is society ready to forgive him and those like him? Or will fear and prejudice once again tear the world apart? Pulsing with provocative parallels to our troubled times, The Cured is a smart, scary, and hauntingly human tale of guilt and redemption\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms",1

With the filmâ€™s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.\n\nReprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy AwardÂ® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd and OscarÂ® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophieâ€™s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadwayâ€™s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).",24

"Rescue of scared homeless dog, heartbroken and sad, living on the cold streets. This sweet old dog was found roaming near a railroad station. It was too risky to attempt a rescue there, we were worried that he could run and get hit by a passing train, so we followed him, trying to redirect him towards a safer place. It was quite a marathon as he ran away each time we approached him. But he eventually understood we are only trying to help him, or maybe the smell of the yummy treats finally reached his nose. He was limping and we also noticed a scar near his left eye so we took him straight to the veterinary clinic. When we scanned him for a microchip we discovered that he had an owner! We hoped a happy dog-owner reunion would follow, but when we contacted the registered owner he told us he does not want the dog back and asked us to take him. Apparently, Bobi (this is the name given by his owner) ran away from home and traveled quite a long distance, being found approximately 10 miles away from his home. Weâ€™ll never know why he left home and why he wasnâ€™t wanted anymore, but we do not want to judge anyone, weâ€™re just thankful that we were able to save him.\nBobi is 9 years old, medium sized, approximately 18 kg (39 lbs), fully vaccinated, microchipped, neutered. His vision is completely lost in the left eye, an old scar located near the eye indicates that he had been injured there, possibly hit, so thatâ€™s how he lost his sight in that eye. But the good news is that vision in the right eye is not affected and he sees well with it. \nHeâ€™s very gentle, loving and obedient and he is still playful and curious. It's like he's living now the puppyhood he missed. \nBobi is an old dog in his golden years and he needs a caring adoptive family to offer him a home, a FOREVER home this time, where he can spend his remaining years happy and loved. He is in Howl Of A Dogâ€™s care in Romania, but please note that we also allow international adoptions and he can travel to the USA, Canada or Europe. \nTo adopt Bobi please check our adoption procedure: www.howlofadog.org/adoption-procedure/ or send us an email on contact@howlofadog.org.

"Leading a more active lifestyle takes time, effort, and determination, but in the end, it's really worth the shot. Here's what will happen to your body when you exercise regularly.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nIf you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle, you're not alone. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports, fitness, and recreation. Whether you're trying to get fit or build muscle, or you're just tired of the couch, here are some changes you can expect along the way.\n\nWhat happens to your body when you start exercising regularly?\n\nDuring that first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain. But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\n\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\n\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\n\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\n\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\n\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\n\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\n\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",28

"Comparing the food environment of the U.S. to Japan's.\nâ–²Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/WILearned\nâ–²Twitter: https://twitter.com/jeverettlearned\nâ–²Bitcoin: 1CuSEgDr5raV3XKoHL7W19QRoCkE3iHt1X\n\nThis video highlights the difference between the food environment of America and Japan. America's obesity rate is about 30% (biggest state is 37.7%, smallest 22.3%) whereas Japan's obesity rate is 3.5%\nWhile there's other countries on each side of the obesity spectrum, I chose to compare these two because I grew up in America and spent the last 7 years here in Japan. The places that I describe as reasonably healthy in Japan aren't necessarily places I recommend as optimally healthy - I'm simply point out that while convenient food in America ranges from very unhealthy to unhealthy, convenient food in Japan ranges from very unhealthy to pretty healthy. \n\nBig thanks to Itchban for letting me use his footage (6:30 - 6:48):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/itchban\nhttp://www.instagram.com/itchban \n\nFeatured Music:\nBroke for Free - As Colorful as ever\nGraphiqs Groove - Deep Sky Blue\n\nFor Business inquiries: \njoseph.everett.wil@gmail.com",22

Most of these schools are run by publicly-traded companies, which means the profits they earn after running schools with taxpayer funds go toward paying their shareholders. These schools enroll less than 1% of American public school students right now, but the share is growing.  In their ads, these schools promise autonomy and flexibility. They appeal to students eager to escape bullies or classrooms where they feel unsuccessful. But the data show that attending these schools sets kids back academicallyâ€” by a lot. And despite their poor performance, states have been slow to close these schools down.\n\nReading list: \n\nArianna Prothero and Maya Riser-Kositsky calculated the lobbying and campaign spending totals for K12 and Connections Academy for Education Week/edweek.org: https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/11/03/outsized-influence-online-charters-bring-lobbying-a.html\n\nThis 2015 study from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University is the most comprehensive nationwide look at online charters to date. Researchers there found that attending an online charter school for a year is equivalent to missing 180 days of instruction in math, and 72 days of instruction in reading: https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/OnlineCharterStudyFinal2015.pdf\n\nJune Ahn (NYU) and Andrew McEachin (RAND) did a similar study of Ohioâ€™s online charter schools and got similar results. They found that even high-achieving students who attending online charters in that state ended the year significantly behind their peers in brick-and-mortar schools: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17692999\n\nThanks to folks at the National Education Policy Center for sharing their data on online charter enrollment from 2011 through 2016.

"STOP! First, subscribe to Alec Steele's amazing YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith\nCheck out the 3 videos of the plane blade being forged - https://youtu.be/017RX4U5BTI\n\nTHANK YOU TO ROCKLER FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE!\n                  http://www.rockler.com\n\nLife lesson.  Never say no to Alec Steele.  He asked if I'd be interested in coming up with a collaborative project and my answer was OMG yes!  We decided to make a high angle smoother plane.   Damascus steel blade, hand forged by Alec, and the plane body, sculpted by me.  Originally there were going to be two blades and two planes, but blacksmithing is hard!  One of the blades didn't pass QC so Alec moved ahead with just the single blade. \n\nThis is a high angle smoother plane.  It is made to take thin layers of wood off of lumber to leave a super smooth surface that requires minimal sanding.  This is especially useful for highly figured wood.\n\nSpeaking of highly figured wood, the body of the plane is made out of some amazing curly walnut.  For a little extra flair, I added a paduak racing strip to the right side. The Rockler Bandy Clamps made the glue ups a breeze.\n\nHand planes are devilishly easy to make, but incredibly difficult to make right.  I did a ton of research before getting started to calculate angles, size, shape, and even materials to give myself the best chance of success.  If I someday decide this design doesn't work for me anymore, I can simply build another one.  The blade isn't going anywhere!  All the angled cuts were made on the Rockler Table Saw Sled so I could do them safely and accurately.  This is possibly my number one favourite tool from Rockler.  The sled is perfect.\n\nI roughed out the shape on the bandsaw before sculpting the shape with files, chisels and sandpaper.  The Rockler T-Track Table made this so easy since I was able to flip, rotate and adjust the placement of the plane so I could easily trim wherever I needed to.  Once I was happy with the shape and it fit my hands nicely I sanded for hours.  Every surface was sanded to 400.\n\nTo compliment the paduak stripe I chose a 1/4 copper rod instead of the more traditional brass rod.  I drilled the hole, polished the rod and hammered it home.  Friction is enough to keep it from going anywhere.  The wedge was cut from scrap and sanded to fit perfectly against the blade.  The fit of the wedge is extremly important to how well the plane performs.  \n\nAfter ensureing all parts of the plane work together perfectly I applied 2 coats of danish oil.  It gave the plane a beautiful low luster finish while bringing out the figure of the wood perfectly.  After a few weeks I will come back and give it a light waxing.  \n\nI think thats everything... Be sure to check out the 3 videos Alec made showing how the plane blade was forged.  It's incredible to watch and Alec's energy is infectious.  You will just be happy after watching.  Also a big thank you to Rockler for supporting not only me, but so many makers around the world.  \n\n===========================================\n- Instagram - http://instagram.com/dpmakestuff\n- Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/dpmakestuff\n- Plans - http://www.dpmakestuff.com\n\n===========================================\n= Links To Tools Used =\n\nTape Cutter:  http://amzn.to/2wExKdG\nTable Saw Sled: http://shrsl.com/r87s\nBandy Clamps: http://shrsl.com/r87v\nT-Track Table: http://shrsl.com/r88e\nFlexcut Chisels: http://shrsl.com/r88f\nSilicon Mat: http://amzn.to/2FldFL4\nGlue Brush: http://amzn.to/2EgCgBp\nDanish Oil: http://amzn.to/2EdW3kW\nWooden Mallet:  http://amzn.to/2gLRJ4I\nRuler:  http://amzn.to/2bOARY4\nTitebond Glue:  http://amzn.to/1TmiBAs\nChisels:  http://amzn.to/2w5fKpm\nForstner Drill Bits:  http://amzn.to/2bRDTMk\nF Clamps:  http://amzn.to/2gL4lJy\n\n===========================================\n\n= Bookmark these to support the channel =\n- Amazon - http://amzn.to/2ezs5zq\n- Amazon Canada - http://amzn.to/2vVrz1m\n\n===========================================\n\n= Shop Equipment =\nRockler Stuff:  http://amzn.to/2bYUGJf\nSaw Stop:  http://amzn.to/2ctLWdP\nBand Saw:  http://amzn.to/2c72OZN\nLathe:  http://amzn.to/2e9IjMN\nX Carve CNC:  https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\n\n===========================================\nFeeling like sending me a letter, stickers or crisp 100 dollar bill?

"On Wednesday, Jan. 24th, 2018 SpaceX completed the first static fire test of the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle.  When Falcon Heavy lifts off, it will be the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.  \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars.",28

"More Celebrity News â–ºâ–º http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nAlong with many other talented artists, Childish Gambino performed tonight at this yearâ€™s Grammy Awards and absolutely killed it. It was actually his first ever time performing at the annual awards ceremony and letâ€™s just say he did not disappoint. Looking handsome as ever in an all white suit, he absolutely crushed the performance of his stand-alone track â€˜Terrified,â€™ off his nominated album â€˜Awaken, My Love.â€™\nNot only did he melt our hearts with that voice, he then completely surprised us by bringing JD McCrary up on stage to sing with him. Who, also sung like an actual angel.\nTonight felt like a preview of whatâ€™s to come, since Donald Glover and JD will actually be starring in a movie together, as they both are set to be in the Live-Action Lion King film.  JD will be voicing Young Simba and Donald will be voicing older Simba. And after this performance, we completely understand the casting choice.  \nThis was definitely a big night for Childish Gambino. In case that performance wasnâ€™t enough, his track â€˜Redboneâ€™ just won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBut right now I wanna turn it over to you guys. What did you think of Childish Gambinoâ€™s performance?

"The Supermoon Trilogy we've been experiencing since December will end with a bang on January 31st, combining a Supermoon, a Blue Moon, and a Total Lunar Eclipse. Slooh will livecast the entire eclipse, starting at 5:45am EST. Its duration is a projected 5 hours, 17 minutes, with the totality phase lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, starting at approximately 7:50am EST. Join our team of experts at 7:00am EST as they share the fascinating science, ancient lore, and human stories behind lunar eclipses - that most captivating of celestial events - as well as supermoons and blue moons. The eclipse will be visible from western North America, the Pacific Ocean, Australia, and parts of Asia. Slooh will feature live feeds from partners in Hawaii, Australia and Asia. \n\nThis is the first total Lunar Eclipse since September 28, 2015 and it has been almost seven years since has one entered as deeply into the umbral shadow as this one will! The next total Lunar Eclipse will be on July 27, 2018. Total lunar eclipses are often referred to as â€œBlood Moonsâ€ because of the reddish color the Moon assumes during totality and this one promises to have a vibrant and ruddy hue. This trilogy of large full moons is not rare, but a wonderful cosmic rhythm - supermoons generally come in threes. When a Full Moon occurs when the Moon is near its closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit (termed perigee), we call it a Supermoon. Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from specific locations on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible anywhere it is nighttime. \n\nThe winner and runners-up of the first Fenimore Cooper Prize for Eclipse Writing will also be announced. Slooh launched this contest in August to commemorate the 2017 Transcontinental Eclipse; read all of the finalistsâ€™ submissions in Januaryâ€™s Best of Illuminations.",28

Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our countryâ€™s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productionsâ€™ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonacoâ€™s longtime production partner, SÃ©bastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com",24

Red is tired of people trying to eat him so he makes a wish to be human.,24
"After finishing school, Jocelyn and Jarvis had $96,000 of debt from student loans, credit cards, and buying a small rural property.  This is the story of how they paid it off in just 20 months, and then built themselves a debt-free custom tiny house for their family of 4.\n\nAfter ignoring their finances for a long time, the couple finally faced reality one night when they sat down and added up all of their debts, and compared it to the revenue they had coming in.\n\nWhen they realized how much they owed, they decided to make some drastic changes so they could pay it off and stop worrying about money.\n\nTo start, they moved to a smaller apartment, changed jobs, shopped second-hand, froze a credit card in a block of ice, switched to using cash only, and made a budget that allowed them to chip away at their debt.\n\nThey had a white board with a list of all their debts, which they updated every time a payment was made so they'd continue to be motivated.  After 20 months, they were completely debt-free.  After that, they continued with their minimalist, frugal habits and were able to save up enough money to build themselves a custom tiny house on wheels.\n\nThey've been living in the tiny house for over two years now, with their two children, and plan to continue living in it for as long as they can.  They are currently saving money to buy a small acreage where they will build a larger off grid home and keep the tiny house as an income property.\n\nWe're very inspired by this young family's dedication to improve their lives by paying off their debt, by their awareness of their energy consumption, by their efforts to buy less and live a low waste lifestyle.\n\nThey're trying to make positive change in every aspect of their lives, and that's not always an easy thing to do.  \n\nThank you, Jocelyn and Jarvis, for sharing your story with us!  And for the beautiful day we spent at your place! \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nMat & Danielle\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT OUR CHANNEL!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you to all of our Patrons who support us so generously and a very special thank you to our backbone supporters: The Burgess Family!\n\nIf you like our videos, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/exploringalternatives\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlog: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: /exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: @exploringalternatives\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSUBTITLES AND CLOSED CAPTIONS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA very special thank you to our subtitle and closed captions contributors! \n\nIf you would like to contribute subtitles or closed captions to an Exploring Alternatives video, please click here to see which ones need your help:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC8EQAfueDGNeqb1ALm0LjHA&tab=2\n\nTo learn how to create and submit subtitles and closed captions, check out this YouTube info page:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623\n\nIf you would like credit for your subtitles, translation, or closed captions in the description of the video, please email us with your full name, the language of your translation, and the video title that you worked on.

"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom â€” and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summerâ€™s events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dadâ€™s footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdaleâ€™s young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. Itâ€™s all weighing heavily on Archieâ€™s mind â€” as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but sheâ€™s not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Bettyâ€™s nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (MÃ¤dchen Amick), arenâ€™t the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), thereâ€™s an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesnâ€™t want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then thereâ€™s Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdaleâ€™s Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œGleeâ€), Greg Berlanti (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€), Sarah Schechter (â€œArrow,â€ â€œThe Flash,â€ â€œSupergirl,â€ â€œDCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrowâ€) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",24

"Made this printer out of a scanner, CD-ROM drive, mechanical hard drive, Arduino Duemilanove, Meccano, three motor driver boards, and a pencil.\n\nI use a point cloud software called CloudCompare to convert image data into a raster, and then export it as an ascii text file containing x,y,z,color values. Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control). Print resolution / size is 255 pixels wide by however long the scanner bed is.\n\nI believe it could also be useful in the kitchen for chopping vegetables.",28

It was back in 2016 when Lionsgate hired Hamilton star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to serve as a creative producer and musical mastermind on the feature film and TV series adaptations, along with Rothfuss. \n\nAccording to Variety, TriStar Pictures has landed worldwide distribution rights to the Mr. Rogers biopic â€œYou Are My Friend,â€ with Tom Hanks attached to play Mr. Rogers. Diary of a Teenage Girl director Marielle Heller is helming the pic from a script by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster.

"It's the second SpaceX launch of 2018! SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a 4200 KG satellite called GovSat-1/SES-16 to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. This satellite serves the Luxembourg Government and a commercial customer SES. This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX. This is the 29th launch from SpaceX's launch pad, SLC-40, and the 48th over all launch of the Falcon 9. \n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/",28

Why isnâ€™t â€˜Off to the Vetâ€™ available in full on YouTube? A. â€˜Off to the Vetâ€™ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simonâ€™s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simonâ€™s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com",15

That speech is used to reflect on the progress of the previous year and help set the presidentâ€™s agenda for the coming year.\n\nThis is Trump's first official State of the Union Address. The speech Trump gave last year to a joint session of Congress was not called the State of the Union. A presidentâ€™s address during his or her first year in office is never referred to as a State of the Union address because after just a few weeks into his term, a new president isnâ€™t expected to know the full state of the union.",25

"Hey we found a solution to the problem of the magnetized marbles for the Marble Machine X! This demagnetizer / degausser is purely mechanical, just what i hoped for. By using disc magnets, with the polarities arranged in an alternate pattern we can very effectively demagnetize the marbles by letting them enter and exit the alternating magnetic field. \n\nCheck out Play With Junks Youtubevideo that helped convince me of this method: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-s_oXe9tmk\n\nBTW I read on Wikipedia that magnetism is nowadays considered a truly quantum mechanical effect, one which can not be explained by classical physics. Maybe that's why we never stop being mesmerized by magnetism. \n\nWe missed last Wednesday cause of problems with the video  again, will work hard to not miss out on Wednesdays like that.\n\nSome of you might see a Sponsor button that have popped up next to the subscribe button on the Wintergatan Channel.

Starring Academy and Emmy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Angela Bassett (â€œAmerican Horror Story,â€ â€œWhatâ€™s Love Got to Do with Itâ€), the series is based on the real-life, high-pressure experiences of emergency response providers who are thrust into heart-stopping situations that are equal parts unpredictable, intense and uplifting. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives. Emmy Award- and Golden Globe-nominated actor Peter Krause (â€œThe Catch,â€ â€œSix Feet Underâ€) and Emmy Award-nominated actress Connie Britton (â€œNashville,â€ â€œFriday Night Lights,â€ â€œAmerican Horror Storyâ€) have been cast in lead roles. Oliver Stark (â€œInto The Badlandsâ€), Aisha Hinds (â€œShots Fired,â€ â€œUndergroundâ€), Kenneth Choi (â€œThe People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Storyâ€) and Rockmond Dunbar (â€œPrison Break,â€ â€œThe Pathâ€) have been cast in series regular roles. The series will premiere in 2018.\n9-1-1 is produced by 20th Century Fox Television in association Ryan Murphy Television and Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision. The pilot is created, written and executive-produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. Tim Minear is an executive producer and will serve as showrunner. Bradley Buecker is an executive producer and will direct the series premiere.\n\nFirst Responders Arrive To The Collapsed Floor | Season 1 Ep. 5 | 9-1-1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpTHZPdFG-3GxngAHh6Mkew",24

Hall (TVâ€™s â€œDexterâ€ and â€œSix Feet Underâ€) and Kyle Chandler (â€œManchester by the Sea,â€ TVâ€™s â€œBloodlineâ€).\n\nBateman and McAdams star as Max and Annie, whose weekly couples game night gets kicked up a notch when Maxâ€™s charismatic brother, Brooks (Chandler), arranges a murder mystery party, complete with fake thugs and faux federal agents. So when Brooks gets kidnapped, itâ€™s all part of the gameâ€¦right?  But as the six uber-competitive gamers set out to solve the case and win, they begin to discover that neither this â€œgameâ€â€”nor Brooksâ€”are what they seem to be.  Over the course of one chaotic night, the friends find themselves increasingly in over their heads as each twist leads to another unexpected turn.  With no rules, no points, and no idea who all the players are, this could turn out to be the most fun theyâ€™ve ever hadâ€¦or game over.\n\nâ€œGame Nightâ€ is written by Mark Perez (â€œAcceptedâ€).  John Davis (â€œJoyâ€), John Fox (TVâ€™s â€œThe Blacklistâ€), Jason Bateman and Jim Garavente (â€œBad Wordsâ€) are producing. Serving as executive producers are Marc S. Fischer, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and Dave Neustadter.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes team includes director of photography Barry Peterson (â€œCentral Intelligence,â€ â€œWeâ€™re the Millersâ€), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (â€œHow the Grinch Stole Christmas,â€ â€œApollo 13â€), editors Jamie Gross (â€œVacationâ€), Gregory Plotkin (â€œGet Outâ€) and David Egan (â€œMystery Science Theater 3000: The Returnâ€), and costume designer Debra McGuire (â€œVacation,â€ â€œTedâ€).\n\nThe film will be released worldwide beginning February 23, 2018.\nâ€œGame Nightâ€ is a New Line Cinema presentation and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.\n\nRated R for language, sexual references and some violence.",24

"After 3 months of work and probably more than 500 fails, I'm happy to present you my best video ever. \nSince magnets and marbles I've always wanted to make a big chain reaction in one take with this 2D style ! \n\nIt's also a one marble path which means you have to follow the same marble for all the tricks (in that case the little blue one.) Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !",24

"Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit.

That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced.

"Cities want football teams. Owners want stadiums.\n\nWatch how NFL rule changes made linemen gigantic: http://bit.ly/2BSOf5n\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn the past 20 years, over $7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of NFL football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesnâ€™t hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. \n\nFor owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.\n\nFor cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them.\n\nNew stadiums arenâ€™t the economic powerhouses owners promise theyâ€™ll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"When Falcon Heavy lifts off, it will be the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.  With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFalcon Heavy's first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. \n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separate from the center core and return to landing sites for future reuse.  The center core, traveling further and faster than the side boosters, also returns for reuse, but lands on a drone ship located in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt max velocity the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth.",28

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nï¼Sukiyaki Sauceï¼\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nï¼Vegetablesï¼\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25Â°C/77Â°F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15Â°C/59Â°F 20 hours\nWinter: 5Â°C/41Â°F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75Â°C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well.",26

The burial site lies in a village that existed long before the Aztecs, in the southern part of what is now Mexico City. Bodies had one arm placed below the back of the next in the six-foot-wide round pit. Some bodies show aesthetic modificationâ€”dental filing and head reshaping. Some hold stones or ceramic spheres. The arrangement of the dead implies a single event, not a buildup of remains.

"We have an updated version of this webcast that includes both side booster cameras and additional Starman views here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCc16uozHVE\n\nWhen Falcon Heavy lifts off, it will be the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars.",28

"SpaceX just launched a Tesla Roadster to Mars on this: SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket.Â \n\nThis was the Falcon Heavy's maiden flight. It's the launch that everyone's been waiting for. The Falcon Heavy is a monster.Â \n\nIt has 27 engines, can generate more power than 18 747 jumbo jets, and is the most powerful rocket to fly since NASA's moon rocket, the Saturn V.\n\nMaking it the most powerful functioning rocket on Earth.Â This is one of SpaceX's most difficult launches.Â Musk even said Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up.\n\nBut it didn't!\n\nEven though this was a test launch, Musk took the opportunity to send some payload to space.Â A Tesla Roadster, which will eventually reach Mars' orbit.\n\nNow, that's a rocket test like we've never seen before.Â Afterward, SpaceX retrieved each of the 3 boosters for possible reuse.Â They landed one booster on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean and 2 at its landing base in Florida.\n\nMusk has said the Falcon Heavy could usher people to Mars someday in the future.Â That day now looks closer than ever.Â And who knows?\n\nMaybe a Roadster will be waiting when they get there.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",28

"Enjoy the smiles and surprise on locals' faces as I speak to them in their local language in India! And laugh at my Hindi too if you're a native Hindi speaker =D Jai Hind.\n\nFor everyone commenting on my use of tu (intimate form of you): In Haryana people use tu commonly, even for elders. So that's why I was practicing with it in some sentences. Most of this was filmed in Haryana. Outside of Haryana its use is  considered offensive. Haryanvi is a very informal dialect.\n\nDon't forget to check the rest of my videos on my channel.",19

"With its witchâ€™s hat turrets, spiderweb windows and Gothic spires, Sarah Winchesterâ€™s 24,000-square-foot Victorian house in San Jose, California, draws tourists from around the world.  \n\nThey hear tales of its construction inspired by guilt and its haunting by ghosts. But to the rifle fortune heiress, it was simply her hobby house. From 1886 to 1906, she lavished time, attention and considerable cash on the workshop where she unleashed her ambitious architectural fantasies using the most luxurious and innovative materials of her time.\n\nhttps://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/74768830/list/houzz-tv-beyond-the-ghost-stories-of-the-winchester-mystery-house",26
"I'll Stand By You Commercial | The Unsung: MassMutual was founded on the principle of people protecting people, and we hold onto the belief that our world is full of others who share these values. If you look close enough, youâ€™ll see that people really are looking out for one another all around us. These people are the embodiment of our Live Mutual philosophy and their stories deserve to be heard and shared widely. \n\nPeople like the Texans who used fishing boats to scour flooded neighborhoods for people trapped in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. And the motorcycle group in Indiana who escorted an 11-year old bullying victim to his first day of middle school to make him feel supported. \n\nHear more of their stories here: http://bit.ly/2BvriH3",27
